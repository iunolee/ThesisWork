Bob Dylan,Talkin' New York,"Rambling out of the wild west
Leaving the towns I love best
Thought I'd seen some ups and down
'Till I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Building going up to the sky
Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn't feel so cold then
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folksingers here
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about he loved my sound
Dollar a day's worth
After weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It don't take too long to find out
Just what he was talking about
A lot of people don't have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks and knives
And they gotta cut something
So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And heated out for the western skies
So long New York

No, I didn't mean that at all

Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part

Fucking strange

She said, ""time to go now""
But leavin' it ain't easy

Well, kill me now 'cause I let you down
I swear one day I'm gonna leave this town
Stop!
Yes, I'm leaving, 'cause it just won't work
And they act like Romans, but they dress like Turks

See me, I like the summertime but, hey
Nina's in the bedroom
She said, ""time to go now""
But leaving, it ain't easy
Oh, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go, oh
Trapped in an apartment
She would not let them get her

I got to come clean but the authorities they've seen

The world was so thin between my bones and skin
There stood another person who was a little surprised
To be face to face with a world so alive
How I fell (did you feel low?)
No (huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus De Milo
You know it's all like some new kind of drug
My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves
Broadway looked so medieval
It seemed to flap, like little pages
And I fell sideways laughing
With a friend from many stages
How we felt (did you feel low?)
Not at all (huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus De Milo
Suddenly my eyes went so soft and shaky
I knew there was pain but pain is not aching
Then Richie, Richie said
""Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do""
Something, something said ""you better not""
And I fell (did you feel low?)
Nah (huh?)

Tom Waits,Downtown Train,"Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
They all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLtZKkCIVmI,

Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind
I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockys under the evergreens
I know what I'm needin', and I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind
It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
Oh yeah
It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News
Who, oh, oh whoa who
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line

Start spreading the news
You're leaving today (tell him friend)
I want to be a part of it, New York, New York
Your vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray
And steps around the heart of it, New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find your king of the hill, top of the heap
Your small town blues, they're melting away
Don't make a brand new start of it, in Old New York
You always make it there, you make it anywhere
Its up to you, New York, New York

Rufus Wainwright,14th Street,"You've got my lost brother's soul
My dear mother's eyes
A brown horse's mane
And my uncle's name
You walked me down 14th Street
For the doctor to meet after thoughts of the grave
In the home of the brave and of the weak
But why'd you have to break all my heart
Couldn't you have saved a little bit of it?
Why'd you have to break all my heart?
Couldn't you have saved a minor part?
I could have clipped and saved and planted in the garden
Damn you guess I'll have to get a new one
I'd love to sit and watch you drink
With the reins to the world, gripping a smoke
Vaguely missing link
Don't ever change you hungry little bashful hound
I got the sheep, poor little Bo Peep
Has lost and filed for grounds.
But why'd you have to break all my heart
I could have ripped apart and thrown into the river
Wonder if there's hearts that will deliver
Don't ever change, don't ever worry
Because I'm coming back home tomorrow
To 14th Street where I won't hurry
And where I'll learn how to save, not just borrow
And they'll be rainbows and we will finally know",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbie_ER_tjE,

But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim boss, just because
And they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well outta south Alabama came a country boy
He say I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool shootin' boy
My name Willie McCoy
But down home they call me slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd street
He drivin' a drop top cadillac
Last week he took all my money
And it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back
And everybody say Jack don't you know
And you don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' were done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet
Yeah he were cut in in bout a hundred places
And he were shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor now they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim
Yeah, big Jim got his hat
Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two piece custom made pool cue
Yeah you don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger

The Pogues,Fairytale of New York,"It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jbdgZidu8,

Wheels and it deals
The crowds rush and scramble
Round past the newsstands
And out across the floors

And I did some singing
And I played guitar
Down near a doorway
Howling out words
And banging out chords

Well, think what you will
Laugh if you like
It don't make no difference to me
I'll open my case
And I might catch a coin
But all ears may listen for free

Big clocks were tickin'
Trains came and went
Sad, ragged figures
Limped in the hallways
And dug through the trash

While old folks and young folks
Passed in a flood
On dashing somewhere
Wrapped in their lives
And gone in a flash

Well, think what you will
Laugh if you like
It don't make no difference to me
I'll open my case
And I might catch a coin
But all ears may listen for free

Well, a man came a talkin'
He stopped where I stood
He warned me so gravely
“The cops here'll nab ya, boy
And they'll take ya right on down, yes.”

But I took my chances
And luck saw me through
I stayed until I'd finished
Played what I pleased
And poured out my sound

Well, think what you will
Laugh if you like
It don't make no difference to me
I'll open my case
And I might catch a coin
But all ears may listen for free",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4imchaPJ8g,

Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
You know we're thorough in the boroughs 'cause that's a must
I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIX
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves

Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's, got thrown out
Sneakin' in at four am after going out
You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From ten-ten WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York, this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We can't say enough about all you do
'Cause in the city we're ourselves and electric too
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Lifelong, we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 9-11 we're still livin'
And lovin' life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us
We lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust
Dear New York I know a lot has changed
Two towers down but you're still in the game
Home to the many, rejecting no-one
Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan

Rules and regulations to me, me

I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
Ooh I'll put my spell on her
Here she comes
Walkin' down the street
Here she comes
Comin' through my door
Here she comes
Crawlin' up my stair
Here she comes
Waltzin' through the hall
In a pretty red dress

Hear this knockin' on my door
And I look up into the big tower clock
And say, 'oh my God here's midnight!'
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name

There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
Marie and ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
Counting the time, then you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine

It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You won't need a launderette, you can take it to the vet!
I get my advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
Koka Kola advertising and kokaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper, they're crazy!
Suit your life, maybe so
In the White House, I know
All over Berlin (they've been doin' it for years)
And in Manhattan!
Coming through the door is a snub nose forty four
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leaping from the windows saying don't
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh!
Don't give me none of this!
Koke adds life, advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
Hit the deck!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8zqDVaNg6w,
Lou Reed,New York Telephone Conversation,"I was sleeping, gently napping, when I heard the phone
Who is on the other end talking, am I even home
Did you see what she did to him, did you hear what they said
Just a New York conversation, rattling in my head
Oh, my, and what shall we wear
Oh, my, and whop really cares
Just a New York conversation, gossip all of the time
Did you hear who did what to whom, happens all the time
Who has touched and who has dabbled here in the city of shows
Openings, closings, bad repartee, everybody knows
Oh, how sad, why do we call
Oh, I'm glad to hear from you all
I am calling, yes I'm calling just to speak to you
For I know this night will kill me, if I can't be with you
If I can't be with you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7gBPBBZHw4,

Run em' under water shark
Infested sea of secrets

Woody Guthrie,Jesus Christ,"Jesus Christ was a man that traveled through the land
Hard working man and brave
He said to the rich, ""Give your goods to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave
Yes, Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
Laid poor Jesus in His grave
He went to the preacher, He went to the sheriff
Told them all the same
""Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave
When Jesus come to town, all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
The bankers and the preachers, they nailed Him on the cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
And the working people followed him around
Singing and shouting gay
But the cops and soldiers nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death
Everybody wondered why
It was the landlord and the soldiers that they hired
To nail Jesus Christ in the sky
This song was made in New York City
Of rich man and preachers, and slaves
If Jesus was to preach like He preached in Galillee
They would lay Jesus Christ in His grave
Yes, Jesus was a man and a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
As laid poor Jesus in His grave",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDS00Pnhkqk,

You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha)
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!
A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Looking down on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marching up the avenue
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm living in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why
Too much, too many people, too much

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump""
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes out in the street
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race?
Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha)
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!
Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares

I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work

Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction
One young punk just leaning on the fence
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents

Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up

And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, trying to exist
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger throughout the races
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!""
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail
When you put your baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

And watch her as she grows in my garden

And the feeling is ""lay back""
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back
Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still
Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one
But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why

We met in the springtime
At a rock'n'roll show
It was in the Bowery
When it was time to go
We kissed on the subway
In the middle of the night

Said springtime is coming soon

Cannibal Ox...

Birds of the same feather flock together
Congested on a majestic street corner
That's a short time goal for most of 'em
Cuz most of 'em
Would rather expand their wings and hover over greater things
That's what we call inspired flight
By the pigeons that gotta eat pizza crust every night
And ""Let there be light"" was understood
When a mic-stand descended from up-and-above into the hood
And if my face is worth a thousand words when it's scarred
I would only hope that two of those are cocoa and butter
To heal the wounds
Of the tissue scarred to mark the death of my womb
But I've graduated, got my wings
And you've got to let go of my constructed Lego egg-o-waffle halo
Eh yo, I'm a black man, with an African
Drum in my chest that beats on the opposite of the right
Let me know I got a breath left
In this frigid fragile capsule
That allows you to fly south before the winter winds trap you
I wrap my ""hell I made it"" wetsuit stitch
So I can swim in elevators crazy wet through piss
I'm just a pigeon with one mile left
That doggy-paddles through this bullshit ocean of death
And these rags-to-riches words will break bones
Like the assassination of two birds with one stone
That's why I don't associate with bird brains with their beaks in the air
Pelicans with wide jaws yap names
For fish heads you'll get tossed in the flames
Where some archaeologists will find your skeletal frame

Eskimo medal doctrine locked in oxygen shell
Words shot plated metal lung which spun kids' carrousel
Mega alarm technoloid these boys fight four arms
Swinging two toes very well
Terror toys jubilated mega noise when iron works
Bullet shot animated mad windows with fireworks
Shinin' summer-time hydrants
Splash passing cars, now run ghetto tyrants
These faces carry scars (mega large)
Pigeons turn penguins, talk fables cellular
Detached Christ's Word
But freeze-frame gold chain swing Son of God
Iceberg gem shines on the neck, ghetto flight bird
Getting fly like word
Let it settle
I remember cats snatched off the pedal (stealing bike days)
Doo-rags worn tight (Piranha bite waves)
Smoke cheeba through the lung, Arabian camel
Fast like a cheetah now I'm knocked off my African sandal
God damn you! Ethiopian skin mechanical
Trapped in ghetto's mega yard where mega-hard
Arms swinging metal palms iron skin leopard
Holding evil metal eagle attach the desert
Paranoid fingertips stitched with three-fifty plus seven metal shit
Tucked behind the belt ghetto style like delicate street etiquette
Never lactose, metal cow got milk in her guts settling
Cats gotta eat, swallow beef horribly
Melanin, mahogany, black boys feed face arachnoid
Eight arms working short circuit manufactured, crack melted
Slinging shot guns through the mouth of cracked helmets, black felt it
Cats who pop flows shot heavy through the nostril
Brain sizzle, grab the pistol and get hostile
He caught you alone fuse blown
Unemployed screaming ""That's why I robbed you!""
Tired of the Medicaid, debted by the car
No containers filled with lemonade, ""You better get a job!""
Mother talked, just another hawk
Humiliated bodega food stamp transaction
Left me in corners, buckled me accompanied by evil hands clapping
Rocking my ""hell I made it"" wetsuit stitch
So I can swim in elevators crazy wet through piss
I rock my simulated air tank bit
So I can leave pressures of oxygen where my mic's lit

Because I'm willing and able.
Ain't no faking
Your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking.
While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden
Cold kickin' it live.
No sleep till
Another plane
Another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl
Another fight
Another drive all night.
Our manager's crazy
He always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus.
Tour around the world
You rock around the clock
Plane to hotel
Girls on the jock.
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way
'Cause it's worth your while.
Four on the floor Ad-Rock's out the door
M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore.
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back.
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn, no sleep till Brooklyn !
Ain't seen the light since we started this band
M.C.A. get on the mike, my man!
Born and bred Brooklyn
The U.S.A.
They call me Adam Yauch
But I'm M.C.A.
Like a lemon to a lime
A lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women.
Got limos, arena, TV-shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes
Step off Homes
Get out of my way
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up
Before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week!
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Y0cy-nvAg,
Leonard Cohen,First We Take Manhattan,"They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line there moving through the station?
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those
Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I don't like your fashion business mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
And I thank you for those items that you sent me
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I am guided
Ah remember me, I used to live for music
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTTC_fD598A,

Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, one, two, five
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man
Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man, ah work it now
Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody body's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man
Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I feel oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time

Simon & Garfunkel,The Boxer,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

Run-D.M.C,Christmas in Hollis,"It was December 24th on Hollis ave in the dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my god, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of g's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me
It's Christmas time in Hollis queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink egg nog
The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of darryl's
But each and every year we bust chrsitmas carrols
Rhymes so loud and prod you hear it
It's christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack frost chillin, the ?orchas out?
And that's what christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer
My name's d.m.c. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say merry christmas and happy new year!",,

Joni Mitchell,Chelsea Morning,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_y7O06z77Q,
Nas,N.Y. State of Mind,"Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kicking
Musician, inflicting composition
Of pain I'm like Scarface sniffing cocaine
Holding a M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the celo champs
Laughing at base-heads, trying to sell some broken amps
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shooting
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, ""Back up, "" the Mac spit
Lead was hitting niggas one ran, I made him back flip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
And it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you saying?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back, snatching yo' cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash until the coke price drop
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasing and they wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be having dreams that I'ma gangster, drinking Moets, holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewing up the blocks
To sell rocks, winning gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Give me a Smith and Wessun I'll have niggas undressing
Thinking of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated I'ma hijack Delta
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm living where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice
I'm taking rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhyming is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent, to the new york state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Patti Smith,Piss Factory,"Sixteen and time to pay off
I got this job in a piss factory inspecting pipe
Forty hours thirty-six dollars a week
But it's a paycheck, Jack.
It's so hot in here, hot like Sahara
You could faint in the heat
But these bitches are just too lame to understand
Too goddamned grateful to get this job
To know they're getting screwed up the ass
All these women they got no teeth or gum or cranium
And the way they suck hot sausage
But me well I wasn't sayin' too much neither
I was moral school girl hard-working asshole
I figured I was speedo motorcycle
I had to earn my dough, had to earn my dough

But no you gotta, you gotta (relate, babe,)
You gotta find the rhythm within
Floor boss slides up to me and he says
""Hey sister, you just movin' too fast,
You screwin' up the quota,
You doin' your piece work too fast,
Now you get off your mustang sally
You ain't goin' nowhere, you ain't goin' nowhere.""
I lay back. I get my nerve up. I take a swig of Romilar
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook and I say
""Hey, hey sister it don't matter whether I do labor fast or slow,
There's always more labor after.""
She's real Catholic, see. She fingers her cross and she says
""There's one reason. There's one reason.
You do it my way or I push your face in.
We knee you in the john if you don't get off your get off your mustang Sally,
If you don't shake it up baby."" Shake it up, baby. Twist & shout""
Oh that I could will a radio here. James Brown singing
""I Lost Someone"" or the Jesters and the Paragons
And Georgie Woods the guy with the goods and Guided Missiles ...
But no, I got nothin', no diversion, no window,
Nothing here but a porthole in the plaster, in the plaster,
Where I look down, look at sweet Theresa's convent
All those nurses, all those nuns scattin' 'round
With their bloom hoods like cats in mourning.
Oh to me they, you know, to me they look pretty damn free down there
Down there not having crystal smooth
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel
Not having to worry about the (inspeed) the dogma the (inspeed) of labor
They look pretty damn free down there,
And the way they smell, the way they smell
And here I gotta be up here smellin' Dot Hook's midwife sweat
I would rather smell the way boys smell--
Oh those schoolboys the way their legs flap under the desks in study hall
That odor rising roses and ammonia
And way their dicks droop like lilacs
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell
But no I got, I got pink clammy lady in my nostril
Her against the wheel me against the wheel
Oh slow motion inspection is drivin' me insane
In steel next to Dot Hook -- oh we may look the same--
Shoulder to shoulder sweatin' 110 degrees
But I will never faint, I will never faint
They laugh and they expect me to faint but I will never faint
I refuse to lose, I refuse to fall down
Because you see it's the monotony that's got to me
Every afternoon like the last one
Every afternoon like a rerun next to Dot Hook
And yeah we look the same
Both pumpin' steel, both sweatin'
But you know she got nothin' to hide
And I got something to hide here called desire
I got something to hide here called desire
And I will get out of here--
You know the fiery potion is just about to come
In my nose is the taste of sugar
And I got nothin' to hide here save desire
And I'm gonna go, I'm gonna get out of here
I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna get on that train,
I'm gonna go on that train and go to New York City
I'm gonna be somebody, I'm gonna get on that train, go to New York City,
I'm gonna be so bad I'm gonna be a big star and I will never return,
Never return, no, never return, to burn out in this piss factory
And I will travel light.
Oh, watch me now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aUbrZYjYE,

Bob Dylan,Vision of Johanna,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG8Hi-fpyLI,

PJ Harvey,Good Fortune,"Threw my bad fortune
Off the top of
A tall building
I'd rather have done it with you
Your boy's smile
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love
In Chinatown
Hung over
You showed me
Just what I could do
Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
Just what it was worth
And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say
Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place
When we walked through
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face
I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words
Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world
And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=gDBZZ3uvimE,
Billie Holiday,Autumn in New York,"Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
Autumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York, it lifts you up when you're let down
Jaded roués and gay divorces who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's devine
It's autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York, you'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again",https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=54&v=NO2Ij1eO-GQ,

I just wanna fuck some sluts!

Spent my whole life in the city,
Where junk is king and the air smells shitty.

Piles of blood, scabs and hair.
Bodies wasted in the street,
People dyin' on the street,
But the suburban scumbags, they don't care,

Were your records all you had to pass the time?
Or maybe you were taken by the mysteries of New Orleans?
Or the uptight, rowdy girls of Lower Chelsea?
And we're hustling under but we live in the city
And we keep it down when we take a beating
Yeah, we keep it down with the radio on
And if you find a good man, don't take him home

And spending all of your nights never dancing like you did
While the gravity hangs on all the selling points you had,
She'll still remain the Queen of Lower Chelsea

You daddy's pride?
Did you make all the right moves,
Take all the right drugs right on time?
American girls, they want the whole world
They want every last little light in New York City

And we keep it down when we take a beating
Yeah, we keep it down with the radio on

Snow Patrol,New York,"If you were here beside me instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
I’d tell you that I loved you before I ever knew you
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you
If our hearts are never broken and there’s no joy in the mending
There’s so much this hurt can teach us both
There’s distance and there’s silence, your words have never left me
They’re the prayer that I say every day

Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here

And the lack of it snaps me in two

If you were here beside me instead of in New York
In the arms you said you'd never leave
I'd tell you that it's simple and it was only ever thus

Through the side streets and the alleyway

And she falls so softly beneath him
Jackie's heels are stacked, Billy's got cleats on his boots
Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway and come back home with the loot
It's midnight in Manhattan, this is no time to get cute
It's a mad dog's promenade
So walk tall, or baby, don't walk at all
Fish lady, fish lady, fish lady, she baits them tenement walls
She won't take corner boys, ain't got no money and they're so easy

Oh mama take my hand, and walk with me down Broadway, yeah
I'm a young man and I talk real loud, yeah baby, walk real proud for you
So shake it away, so shake away your street life

PJ Harvey,You Said Something,"On a rooftop in Brooklyn
At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan
I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten
We lean against railings
Describing the colors
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers
How did we get here?
To this point of living?
I held my breath
And you said something
And I'm doing nothing wrong
Riding in your car
The radio playing
We sing up to the eighth floor
A rooftop, Manhattan
At one in the morning
And you said something
That I've never forgotten
You said something
You said something
You said something
That was really important",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUejME0bISY,
Bright Eyes,Train Under Water,"You were born inside of a raindrop
I watched you falling
To your death
And the sun
Well it could not save you
She'd fallen down too
Now the streets are wet
Body of water, toxic and timeless
Atlantic ocean, New York skyline
I always get lost
When I leave the village
So couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace
To the people I meet
While the world waits for an explosion
That instant of light that wipes the slate clean
So don't be fooled
No, don't get lied to
Love was always cruel
Don't act strange
Don't be a stranger
It happened to me now it's happening to you
But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through
Well if I could tame all of my desires
Wait out the weather
That howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind
Now I am riding all over this island
Looking for something to open my eyes
But I still sing glory
From a high-rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time when we are set free
Well don't stay mad
Just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new
And if I don't come back
I mean, if I get sidetracked
It's only cause I wanted to

'Cause I've got wheels
And you want to go for a ride

Harry is the one I think you'll marry
But it's Chris that you kissed after school

I know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a woman
But when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girl

Well, one: I only keep this heap for you

Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme: play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin' time like
""Pappy"" Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether crusing in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water. Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
""How you living?"" Large, a broker charge - cards are mediocre
You flipping coke or playing spit spades and strip poker?

For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1, 000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_srvHOu75vM,

Like a mama you birth me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you murked me by the time I was twenty one
That shit disturbed me but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'm a call her, Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eatin', so much I bought extra
So much so the dinner's now turnin' to breakfast
I only roll Lexus, to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'?

Or demented black hoodies and Timberlanded
Always schemin' you see the green on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence, look what you had me doin'
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude

Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another

Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another

You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
Cause you love me enough to let go of me

Sting,Englishman in New York,"I don't take coffee, I take tea, my dear
I like my toast done on one side

A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun
Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

He's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile

When I cross that bridge,
It'll be as if this don't exist.
Have a prince who is waiting,
And a kingdom downtown.
I'll go back to Manhattan,
As if nothing ever happened
Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
And I won't have to fall,
Don't have to speak at all.
Brooklyn holds you
And holds my heart too.
What a fool I was to think
I could live in both worlds.
Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
And I won't have to fall,

al stewart,modern times,"Hello old friend, what a strange coincidence to find you
It's been fifteen years since we last met, but I still recognised you
So call the barman over here, and let us fill our glasses
And drink a toast to olden times where all our memories lie
Where all our memories lie
Do you remember the time we were young?
Lowly, lowly, low
Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung
On the midnight snow
So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night
Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright
Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday
Do you remember the changes as we grew?
Slowly, slowly, slow
Sneaking in the back way into movies after school
For the evening show
Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site
Checking out the dance floor while the band played 'Hold Me Tight'
See the blonde one over there: I bet she'd be alright
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday
While I talked he sat and he never made a sound
Staring at the glass beside me
Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?
Silence grows on you like ivy
Ivy
Do you remember the church across the sands?
Holy, holy, ho
You stood outside and planned to travel the lands
Where the pilgrims go
So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack
Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac
Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back
Tell me why you look away
Don't you have a word to say?
He said, 'I don't remember ... I Don't want to remember
In fact I've heard too much already
I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink
Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City
Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know
And you just don't understand me
I've got no use for the tricks of modern times
They tangle all my thoughts like ivy
Ivy'
So I left him, and I went out to the street
Lowly, lowly, low
Where the red light girls were coming after me
Forty dollar show
All across the city's heart the lights were coming on
The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song
If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone
A picture-card of yesterday
A photograph of yesterdayAnd far off in a deserted part of town
The shadows like a silent army
Flooded out the rooms in pools of blue and brown
And stuck to all the walls like ivy
Ivy
Ivy",,
al stewart,broadway hotel,"You told the man in the Broadway Hotel
Nothing was stranger than being yourself
And he replied, with a tear in his eye
Love was a rollaway
Just a cajole away
Mist on a summer's day
Nothing was clear
Love was a smile away
Just a defile away
I sought it every way
No one came near.
You asked the man for a room with a view
Nothing was said as he stared at his shoe
Then he replied as he gave you the key
Love was a rollaway
Just an unfold away
That's all there is to say
No one came near.
Alone in your room you hide
As the night rolls by
In the street outside
And you feel over the words he said
Till they turn to rain all around your head
You're seeking a hideaway
Where the light of day
Doesn't touch your face
And a door sign keeps the world away
Behind the shades
Of your silent day.",,
al stewart,in brooklyn,"Oh I come from Pittsburgh to study astrology
She said as she stepped on my instep
I could show you New York with a walk between Fourth Street and Nine
Then out of her coat taking seven harmonicas
She sat down to play on a doorstep
Saying, Come back to my place I will show you the stars and the signs
So I followed her into the black lands
Where the window frames peel and flake
And the old Jewish face behind the lace
Even now trying to get to see what's cooking
Just John the Baptist in the park getting laid thinking there's no-one looking
And its eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
Her house was a dusty collection of rusty
Confusion with landings and tunnels
And leaning bookcases and spaces and faces and things
Where twenty-five Puerto Ricans, Manhattan Mohicans
And Jewish-Italian Pawnbrokers
Lead their theatrical lives in their rooms in the wings
While outside in the black lands
The violent day runs wild
And the black and white minstrels run through the crazy
Alleys while the cops go booking
And ruthless toothless agents sneak around and there's no-one looking
And it's eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
And oh, I'm back in the city again
You can tell by the smell of the hamburger stand in the rain
She spoke of astrology while muttering apologies
For coffee that tasted of hot dogs
I said, That's OK, mine was cold anyway, and just grand
Then she lay on the bed while the radio fed
Us with records and adverts for cat food
And I looked at her, holding my thoughts in the palm of my hand
And outside in the black lands
The evening came and went
And the bums in the street begging money for one last drink
Are hanging round the liquor stores trying to get a foot in
And the girl from Pittsburgh and I made love on a mattress with the new moon looking
And in the cool evening breeze I was down on my knees in Brooklyn",,

Naked with lady, crashed my car
Maxed out all of my credit cards
Blacked out in Brooklyn, all night long

Nowhere to run and hide

Fuck letting up, you're gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
I'm thinking about just saying

I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap

And the impulse disappearsYou can still hold back
Because you don't crack very easilyIt's a time-honored resolution
Because the danger is always nearIt's with you now

Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian Restaurant
Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so nice after
So much time
Do you remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights
Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom
Riding around with the car top
Down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the
Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more
Than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would
Always know how to survive
Brenda and Eddy were still going
Steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would
Be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that
Kind of life
But there we were wavin' Brenda and
Eddie goodbye
They got an apartment with deep
Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought
With the bread
They had saved for a couple
Of years
They started to fight when the
Money got tight
And they just didn't count on
The tears.
They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again
Brenda and Eddie had had it
Already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to
The greasers
The best they could do was
Pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both
Find a way to get by
That's all I heard about
Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I
Told you already
And here we are wavin' Brenda
And Eddie goodbye

And you guess you won't be going back to school

Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head

I never said I was a victim of circumstance

But not on my time

I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me

Didn't even know B.
He had the roots he bought the suits
But the boys didn't like him mto tell you the truth
He had 'J.G.' on his pinky ring and he
Lied about doin' some time up in sing-sing

He told his brother Paulie, something had to be done soon.
He took Paulie and a couple of boys and jacked the
Coup de Ville to Illinois.

Two sticks of dynamite and a .38 Snub

Stood outside the gate with his three man demonstartion
Waving picket signs, the C.O. saw a nine;
And only Paulie go away with the skin on his behind.

Thorough; they raided Franky's room
And then they saw his bureau; upon it was a note,
With a rhyme that was dope, about

I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
'Can I get your autograph L?' No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead
'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

delta spirit,bushwick blues,"Hold on to my hand
Never let go, never let go
We were just two kids acting tough
Then we grew up, me, not so much
All the other guys
That you've seen
Are nothing compared to me
Because my love is strong
And my heart is weak after all
When we first met
We spoke so brief
When you sang a sonnet
I hummed sweet relief
Do you recall that night
We took the L
Out into Bushwick?
It was colder than hell
So maybe there
We should have stopped
'Cause I'm left here
Feeling like a cop
Because my love is strong
And my heart is weak after all
To the other side
Of the state's return
I met a young girl
Well, I couldn't manage her
Because I think of you
In every girl I meet
It's no relief
That sounds to me just as sweet
So maybe I'm the fool
For feeling used
By the way we kissed that night
I though you knew
Because my love is strong
And my heart is weak after all",,

Meeting smile after smile,

Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.

Even stop lights,
Blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures.

See the kids bunch,

With a film of ice

About somewhere
Changed the weather
All around
Just within a trice
You bought me
Violets for my furs
And it was spring
For a while, remember?
You bought me
Violets for my furs
And there was April
In that December
The snow
Drifted on the flowers
And melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew
On the blossoms
As on a summer day
You bought me
Violets for my furs
And there was blue
In the wintry sky
You pinned
The violets to my furs
And gave a lift
To the crowds passing by
You smiled at me
So sweetly
Since
Then one thought occurs
That we fell
In love completely

The jungle creeps over the red brick houses

I train giant gorillas
To chase mamas and papas
Clippety-cloppety
Thumping their breasts
Roaring, 'get off my property!'
No one's allowed
Who says maybe or no
They gotta get out
They just gotta go

Work your life away, makes me wanna cry

Come lock my heart and throw away the key
I'll be there with you baby, until eternity
Take my heart, don't lose the flame babe
I'm always chasing, love again babe
Take my heart, I'm drawing in your love
Oh, big yellow taxi, come drive me home
My girl is waiting just for me, 'cause she's alone
Oh, big yellow taxi, I'm sorry
My girl is waiting just for me, don't tell me a story
I can give you, babe, everything

coolio,on my way to harlem,"I know a place where the trees don't grow
Just another place where niggaz live low
I know a place where life is fucked up
Make a wrong move and your ass get stuck up
Time ain't nothin but a frame of mind
And life is like a mountain or a steep ass climb
I've been lookin for a place to leave
The only free place is inside of me
So let's take a trip, and you don't need a grip
But you better be equipped cause it might be some shit
African-American, nothin but a nigga
Had our fingers on the trigger, but I pulled mine quicker
I know a place where there ain't no calm and
You better stay away if you're soft like Charmin
South Central, Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton
A nigga on the west coast on his way to Harlem
Now it's time to step into the light (Light)
Put up your dukes, there's gonna be a fight (Fight)
And when it's time to fight, you better fight right
Cause if it don't fight right, out goes the light
Take a close look at what I'm freakin on
Niggaz think I'm tweekin, but I'm speakin on
Subject matter, data
Information that I gather
Through my travels
Cause the hardest of the hard, hit hardcore killer
Can't stop the slug of a nine millimeter
Everybody thinks they know, but they know not
If they haven't caught a cap on the block *gunshot*
So shine up your boots and pick up the pieces
Grab a fresh pair of khakis with the sharp ass creases
Ring the alarm, here comes the storm
I got a firearm on my way to Harlem
I know a place where the sun don't shine
Everybody is a victim of neighborhood crime
I know a place where niggaz walk the line
One false step and they must do time
Since I'm in the same boat
I must stay afloat
And sing every note
From the quotes that they wrote
So, I look into the past and walk the path of the greats
So I won't make the same mistakes that sealed my ancestors fates
If I had to be a slave I'd rather be in my grave
If I get in how many lives could I save?
One, two, three, a hundred, a thousand
My heart is poundin, the devil keeps soundin
But he don't want my money, he wants my soul
So I reach like a tree, and like a weed I grow
My stomach is full, but my mind is starvin

Whoever said that the streets were paved with gold
Well I'm afraid that we're all sadly mistaken
There's nothing here 'til you have someone to hold
I love you with all the joy of living
'Til the lights go down in New York City
It's a special love affair
And there's magic in the air
You gotta shake me down
Bring me 'round to my senses
'Til I'm lost and found
And surround me with your senses
If love wasn't here would we reinvent it?
Oh take me down to the very root of my soul
Oh baby say it as if you really mean it
And feel the passion work it's way up through your skin
I love you with all the joy of living

On the long, deep river
Where the moorhens cry
As the first sun quivers in the open sky,
Oh, she came down the river.
Soon, all the leaves were still.
The current was strong and the river was so long.
So, we drink to be renewed.

And the boat starts down the silver river way

In the first light seeing her,

You can always go - downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown - no finer place, for sure
Downtown - everything's waiting for you
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows - downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close - downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

And your moms and your pops didn't even wanna see
I told you it'll be okay
Put my life on the line on the grind hit the streets all day
You've seen that, and the deeds with chase
Hoppin' over them gates, I could see your face
More reason to get away the set
Get runnin', tucked my kids to sleep, tell 'em daddy's coming

bright eyes,train under water,"You were born inside of a raindrop
I watched you falling
To your death
And the sun
Well it could not save you
She'd fallen down too
Now the streets are wet
Body of water, toxic and timeless
Atlantic ocean, New York skyline
I always get lost
When I leave the village
So couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace
To the people I meet
While the world waits for an explosion
That instant of light that wipes the slate clean
So don't be fooled
No, don't get lied to
Love was always cruel
Don't act strange
Don't be a stranger
It happened to me now it's happening to you
But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through
Well if I could tame all of my desires
Wait out the weather
That howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind
Now I am riding all over this island
Looking for something to open my eyes
But I still sing glory
From a high-rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time when we are set free
Well don't stay mad
Just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new
And if I don't come back
I mean, if I get sidetracked

Keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning the lights on
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
And everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper
Have no phone conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
When I start polishing in the evening
By the morning looks like shit
And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to live
Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
But what I tell you in the evening
By the morning won't make sense
You looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Only say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one kid
I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning it's such a drag
Got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I'll try to do the same
Well we might die from that medicine
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane",,

For you.
Light up your face with gladness,
Hide every trace of sadness.
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying.
You'll find that life is still worthwhile-
If you just smile.

Cultivating my own nonsense
Welcome to the wasteland
Where you'll find ashes
Nothing but ashes
Still awake

Bringing movement, bringing life

Sinking

They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls, pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
Sticker smiles sweet as Gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud
And I said, 'Hey, gunner man, that's qucksand, that's quicksand, that ain't mud
Have you thrown your senses to the war, or did you lose them in the flood?'

Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got 'Bound for Glory' in red, white and blue flash paint
He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint
Well, that blaze-and-noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point
And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell, that is, nothin' left that you could sell
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell

And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street
And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose, but he gets blown right off his feet
And some kid comes blastin' 'round the corner, but a cop puts him right away
He lays on the street holding his leg, screaming something in Spanish, still breathing when I walked away
And somebody said, 'Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud'

Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up
I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?",,

Fighting's the only way's to stand your ground
Chorus:
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x)
Bridge:
I've been used, I've been abused
I've had, baby, my regrets
I've been lost, I paid the cost
But there's one thing I ain't gonna forget
Verse 3:
I've heard some hard lines, I've seen some cryin' times
Bad luck and trouble they been friends of mine
Got to stand straight and stare right at your face (fate? )
And play it hard before it's too late
Chorus:
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (8x)",,

bruce springsteen,this land is your land,"Well I rode that ribbon highway
I saw above me the endless sky
I saw below me the golden valley
This land was made for you and me
I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was calling
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
And a voice was sounding
As the fog was lifting
Saying this land was made for you and me",,
bruce springsteen,jungleland,"The Rangers had a homecoming
In Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance
And disappear down Flamingo Lane
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand
Down in Jungleland
The midnight gang's assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they flash unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing
To the records that the DJ plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone
Beneath the city, two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland",,

Well, I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us, yeah
You, me and all that stuff we're so scared of
Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love
Well, there's a crazy mirror showing us both in five D
I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me
There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother
It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love
Well, it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough, yeah
Man meets woman and they fall in love

I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was
Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby, well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times,
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride
Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company

With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat-up old Buick but dressed just like dynamite
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on easy Street
But they said, Johnny, it falls apart so easy, and you know hearts these days are cheap
And the pimps swung their axes and said, Johnny, you're a cheater
And the pimps swung their axes and said, Johnny, you're a liar
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice
Said, Johnny, don't cry

I want to drive you down to the other side of town
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty Lane tonight
All the golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch-fight
Pull thirty-eight's and kiss their girls goodnight
Oh, goodnight, it's alright, Jane
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh, she looked so fine
Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't mind
Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going home
She whispered, Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave me alone
And Johnny cried, Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the vein
Oh, them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good
They left the corners, threw away all of their switchblade knives
And kissed each other goodbye
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the street
He called down, hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and putting his clothes on
She says, those romantic young boys (those romantic young boys), all they ever want to do is fight
Those romantic young boys (those romantic young boys), they're callin' through the window
Hey, Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?
And Johnny whispered, goodnight, it's all tight, Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on lover's lane

And the projects are silent
Bracing for the heat

Twenty-four more hours going by
Traffic was heavy and there was a little rain
Babies were born and people died
Up in Alaska it was thirty-one below
Down in Miami it was hot
Honky tonks were crowded and the people partied on
In church a couple tied the knot
The headlines screamed about the rapid spread of AIDS
Famine and war were in the news
An earthquake shook some far off corner of the world
Another child had been abused
Then something happened in the twinkling of an eye
Some watched in horror as a plane fell from the sky
Trains ran wild and cars were crashing there were ships without a captain
Millions of people had just vanished from the earth
Panic and confusion were the order of the day
Grown men were weeping and some people tried to pray
A mocking echo in the madness seemed to say it's too late
And then a stranger stepped on to the TV screen
He said don't worry I'm the one
Who will bring peace to every corner of this earth
And now the world shall be as one
All kings and governments will give their power to me
I'll put a mark in your right hand
For three and one-half years the whole world was at peace
Then darkness fell upon the land
He went into the temple in Jerusalem one day
He said I'm God you all must bow
To the valley of Megiddo came the armies of the world
It looked as though the end was coming now
Then something happened in the twinklin' of an eye
A mighty trumpet blast and in the eastern sky
Came Jesus on a snow white horse leadin' heaven's shining forces
This is the hour of the final victory
The ones who wore the mark were shoutin' Satan you're a liar
As angels bound him up and threw him in the lake of fire

From his glory days.

You can't make it alone, so you gotta make a move
But you're looking at nobody's eyes
Well that's love, or maybe love come and go
Looking for love is a danger zone
Love don't go begging in the danger zone
You won't get nothing from the danger zone
Tales that you tell from the stories that you'll hear
And you'll get what you can while you may
Don't understand when you're looking for a dame
But it's only a heartbreak away
And you'll learn, faking has no return
No way when you're feeling that way
Will your feet get caught up in the crowd
And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard
But your speakers are way too loud
Like the pain, loving is no big game
Looking for love is a danger zone
No don't go living in the danger zone

Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries

Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight

Glory days, glory days, yeah
Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times,
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye

All right boy watch me working now! (Working now)
Think I'm going down to the well tonight
Well now I'm going to drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

Little of the glory of, well time slips away

I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin' us is very special
Lovin' life and life and livin'
Your very special
Y'all can never be built like me, even if Y'all look at my blueprint
But since Y'all watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance
But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like Y'all fluent
And Y'all done seen how this young'n look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J.
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, Y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays
Cause love is life, and life is livin'
Your very special
Me and Fab are very special
Me and Fab are very special",,

There's no use in crying, it's all over

But I know I won't always be that way

Into the city at night

Like a diamond snake
In a black sky
I am alone now
With my thoughts
Oh how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champa
Shadow of a stranger
I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade it for jade
Or for diamonds
Not for a minute
Not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted
That I was just scared
I am alone now
What I saw on this journey
I saw history go down
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
It's just like a river
Oh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away

Cool and languid for life or long
Safe in shadow,
It's never as dark as the daylight
As the daylight
When I was just knee high
My momma told me never try to be
Someone that I am not
Yet over time I had forgot
A wandering child, so lost at play
He's found himself,
But he can't find his way
In the daylight, oh the daylight
Oh daylight, oh daylight
Life is short
And there's no turning back the time
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb
In that daylight
In my mind
There's a corner I need to turn
Lessons left is a lesson learned
In the daylight
In the daylight
I miss the forest shade
That took me there
The promise I made
Can never leave the dark so dear
Safe and soothing yet I fear
As I recall and I reflect
I see it's safer to connect
To the daylight

There were those in the wings who waited,
Who came this way
Now there gone
But there's always someone at home
Who never forgets who you are

I won't be along no railroad track
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold

Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock

Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling
Cause the hoochies was starin, thinking, 'Why them niggas swearing?'
I'm wondering if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle

Are you looking for something
I promise you one thing
I promise I'll always, always
Be there
Baby girl, stand up and fight
This is not some paradise
It's just where we live
Finally you think you're alright
Then it eats you up alive
You better get used to it
A story about a girl
A story about the world
Are you waking up slowly
Nothing but lonely
Are you waking up
Holding, holding your breath
Are you looking for something
I promise you one thing
I promise I'll always, always
Be there
With all my faith
And all my heart
And all those simple things you are
I know
It's stuck inside your head
You're alone
You better get used to it
And I know
The feeling has to end
You're strong
It sucks you in again
And you're lost
You can't make any sense
This world
It tears you limb from limb
And hold on
You're nothing but the best
Are you waking up slowly
Nothing but lonely
Are you waking up
Holding, holding your breath
Are you looking for something
I promise you one thing
I promise I'll always, always
Be there
With all my faith
And all my heart
And all those simple things you are
With all my faith
And all my heart
And all those simple things you are",,

And I learn another stranger's name

So how do you like your job I said,
He told me once it's no good
I lock up the playgrounds, here in the park

Yeah I am the bully of New York

And our elders are wobbly

You've been everywhere
You've been with some of the most famous guides and hunters in the world
What's the biggest thrill you've ever had out of all of that?

I'll sing a song, it won't take long,
Of the fighting sixty ninth
They're a band of men brave, stout and bold,
From Ireland they came
And they have a leader to the fold,
And Cochran was his name
It was in the month of April,
When the boys they sailed away
And they made a sight so glorious,
As they marched along Broadway
They marched right down Broadway, me boys,
Until they reached the shore
And from there they went to Washington,
And straight unto the war
So we gave them a hearty cheer, me boys,
It was greeted with a smile
Singing here's to the boys who feared no noise,
We're the fighting sixty ninth
And when the war is said and done
May heaven spare our lives
For its only then we can return,
To our loved ones and our wives
We'll take them in our arms, me boys,
For a long night and a day
And we'll hope that war will come no more,
To sweet America
So farewell unto you dear New York,
Will I e'er see you once more
For it fills my heart with sorrow,
To leave your sylvan shore
But the country now it is calling us,
And we must hasten fore
So here's to the stars and stripes, me boys,
And to Ireland's lovely shore
And here's to Murphy and divine,
Of honor and renown
Who did escort our heroes,
Unto the battle ground
And said unto our colonel,
We must fight hand to hand
Until we plant the stars and stripes,
Way down in Dixieland
So we gave them a hearty cheer, me boys,
It was greeted with a smile
Singing here's to the boys who feared no noise,
We're the fighting sixty ninth
And when the war is said and done
May heaven spare our lives

Riding her bike through alphabet city

Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise

That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day

And make love on the floor until the camera made us

You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you
Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
(You know my life is in your hands,
And every breath you take is planned
And all this love goes on forever)
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one

'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.
It's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.
Old new york city is a friendly old town,
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
It's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,
Old mister empire never says a word.
It's hard times from the country,
Livin' down in New York town.
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.
Bought your city on a one-way track,
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.
I'll take all the smog in California
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.
So all you newsy people, spreadin' the news around,
You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.
Hard times in the city,

bob dylan,the boxer,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York city winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me

bob dylan,joey,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, well, he answered, just because
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe Crazy, the baby they called Kid Blast
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost got hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof
Then, the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim
Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, we're not those kind of men
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
What time is it? said the judge to Joey when they met
Five to ten, said Joey, the judge says, that's exactly what you get
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
They let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, I have returned and now I want what's mine
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
I'm around too many children, he'd say, they should never know of one
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, tell 'em it was Crazy Joe
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, he ain't dead, he's just asleep
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row
Cinderella, she seems so easy, 'It takes one to know one,' she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. 'You Belong to Me I Believe'
And someone says, 'You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave'
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette
And he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read, 'Have Mercy on His Soul'
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, 'Get outta here if you don't know'
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row'
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting, 'Which side are you on?!'
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row
Yes, I received your letter yesterday, about the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out my God, they killed them all
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says, and he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you want to draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!
Here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame
Remember that murder that happened in a bar
Remember you said you saw the getaway car
You think you'd like to play ball with the law
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night
Don't forget that you are white
Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure
The cops said a poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
You don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

and stomp em out like a watered roach
I slay my pray and they decay, I blow away and throw away
so go away, cause I don't play
Attackin' like a psychopath breakin' rappers in half
so feel the wrath of Kane!
The man at hand, to rule and school and teach
and reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most, and boast the loudest rap
Kane'll reign your domain!
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let us beat around the ball like an Astro
Then send em to jail for tryin' to pass Go
Shakin' em up, breakin' em up, takin' no stuff
but it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow
so I can flow, now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
and Doug E. Fresh, Stet', KRS and Public Enemy
Blase blah, you know who you are
The red black and green, the sun moon and star
Knowledge of Self, degree of twenty-one after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
with the speech every leecher I'm impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blind'll feel the wrath, of Kane!
Marley Marl break it down!
Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I got a rap ta
those who chose to oppose, friend or foes I still dispose
Blow em out like afros
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yellin' and screamin' and jeerin' but still came out
Off the wall as butter soft-er y'all
So you waited for Kane, to come after all
competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
to play me out position, you on a mission
But stop lyin' and tryin' to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
Bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
rhyme or find the time to design a line
or phrase that pays, so you down in rhyme
I get busy from sun to sun
Only twenty-one, untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes I keep em runnin' like pantyhose
They got soft and tender, front and they'll surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on the trial, war be my style
but when I'm in effect, they feel the wrath, of Kane!
Alright, pump your fists in the air like this y'all
C'mon let me see the fists in the air
C'mon y'all
And let me hear you say yeah, c'mon
(yeah)
C'mon now, yeah, c'mon!
(yeah)
Everybody, yeah, what?
(yeah)
yeah, c'mon
(yeah)
And say hoe-oh (hoe-oh) hoe-oh (hoe-oh)
Say yo baby, yo baby, yo
(Yo baby, yo baby, yo!)
And just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
If you're gettin' cash money and not welfare
Somebody say, ooh yeah! (ooh yeah!)
Ooh yeah! (ooh yeah)
Apollo Theater, I love y'all
Peace!",,
big daddy kane,smooth operator,"Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin' on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin' lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator
Cause I'm so smooth
The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin' many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin' hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator
Cause I'm so smooth
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin' em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours the smooth operator
Cause I'm so smooth
Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin' sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robatussin' on a cough
If you know like I know step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator
Cause I'm so smooth
Ah yeah, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin', peace!",,
big daddy kane,definitely,"In this corner, representin' bk, ny
Who, come again , i
That you can't deny
For the while I stayed, laid back in the shade
Just like a silhouette, however still a threat
Once again, I return just to get my groove on
Bag somethin' that's a size 7/8 and move on
It be nothin' but dime girls I sport
Only time I hit a 3 be on the basketball court
What you thought, the wrath was about to end
Nah baby, never that because I'm out to win
So what if he came back , he ain't even hittin' though
So why you standin' there with yo' nails bitten low?
Mc's tremblin', I plead innocent
But then again, things can get menacin'
Ladies and gentlemen it's the world renown
Come on y'all let's get down, dark gable's in town
Chorus
Put your hands up high if you testify
Are you wit' me? (definitely)
Cause I give it all I got when I rock the spot
Are you wit' me? (definitely)
Ain't gon' be no looking tight, we gon' party tonight
Are you wit' me? (definitely)
One hundred percent proof, help me raise the roof
Are you wit' me? (definitely)
Verse 2
It's somethin' 'bout that kane that I just ain't buying
How can his rap be solid when his flow is liquefying?
He keep it on beat, plus he keep it street
Plus he keep it sweet, I mean his shit be complete
Thank you love that's right keep it real for me
As I run it down to you all skillfully
Because it ain't hard to tell who's the liver one
Got 'em all shooken like allen iverson
See, you talking now but you ain't sayin nothin'
I keep you listeners hittin' the rewind button
You thinkin', maybe I'm the one to bring it to
But, I don't think that's the wise thing to do
Another casualty with the audacity, thinkin' that he can last with me
Fast to see how I massively, drop skills gradually
Hold it down like gravity, naturally
Chorus
Verse 3
I come wit' the flows that go down like water
Some of y'all just ain't got your game in order
Hmn, looks to me as though you're simpin'
Playa hata's that's attemptin', to be the grinch that stole pimpin'
I cram to, understand you, what's your angle?
You don't want to tangle
Actin' all brand new
Nothin' that them can do, when I roll up like bamboo
And dismantle, handle, everyone I ran through
Baby, you can count on me, a sure thing
I be all inside your hood, just like a drawstring
The wack, I restrict 'em, rhymes I kick 'em
Girls I just stick 'em, whose my next victim?
Thinkin' you was ballin', now I'm callin
Yo' bluff(uh huh), sho nuff (well alright)
Who you came out to see in the place to be
The ebony black ice, who that be?
(yours truly)
Chorus",,
big daddy kane,the beef is on,"It's hell up in Harlem, my main man just caught a bad one
Wetted by a magnum when he didn't have none
That goes to show you that even when you're respected
Brothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked
So I went uptown to get the low-down
To see who made the whole thing go down
Word on the streets had it
Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
Came to start static
Some new jacks at the game
Tryin' to get a name
Had a point to prove
Wrong move
So I can't wait to get em all straight
It's a big payback when I retaliate
Steam, I gotta let it off
And I can't wait to set it off
To revenge my main man that's gone
And as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond
The beef is on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
It's time to show them how to get hard
Callin' a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard
For tryin' to friddont and fiddake the middood
But when I get riddude awesome dude
So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
Bedstuy do or die is where I was lookin'
For my boys from roosevelt, albany and marcy
Plus I got a posse over in canarsie
I'm talkin' about ill brothers that don't play
They sit around watchin 'scarface' all day
So here we go, headed up to they scene
Twenty deep in a van like the a-team
We rolled up to see what this joint's about
When one of my boys in the van just pointed em out
So without delay we reacted
And started shootin' like it was target practice
When they saw that we wasn't messin' around
One tried to run, so I had to chase him down
I caught the kid by the corner store deli
Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
I did his jugular vein something violent
Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
We sent fifteen bodies to trapper john
Cos the beef was on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
(I don't happen to trust people
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
To put you in your place)
(You send your boys in I send em back in a paper bag)
Many screamed about a homicide
But when I came to shut em down all the drama died
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
And we roll like the Corleone family
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
In the aftermath everything's destroyed
Like a crew of barbarians
And brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
Cos soon as I see ya, best believe I'ma call your bluff
And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff
Have fallen and they can't get up
My game is a ill one
Cos I'm a real one
Lorda mercy
Nuff controversy
A gangster, a khan
A pimp and a don
Waitin' for the beef to be on",,

Smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House in the hills, thousands and mills
Getting wild in the field with your spouse in brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I found off skills
Check it out, jets fly private
Nigga S5 hybrid, baby test drive my whip
I'm in bed stuy with my chick
On my westside fly shit
Pulling out minks when the weather get chilly
Left eye side kick

Look what I'm seeing, my life just shifted
I feel like I'm breathing
Light that spliff, now I don't even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I'm steaming
'Tron in my cup, holding mine up, toasting to the slut that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five star sheets, put her right to sleep
Then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my car goes last
Now my car so fast that I don't think you'll understand it in a murcielago dash
When you ride through the dirt and you work til it hurt than you end up on marshall's staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the grammy's
Get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her
So that you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a conglomerate, like this

What a success story
When the film plays it gets less gory
My son didn't know who his pop was for years
Now it's less maury, god put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with a vest at 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 44f's adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach I get paranoid
Where I'm from tell me never let you're guard rest
But it's simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the pole and they far fetched
Now jets fly high shit
That panamera porsche that's ryan's fly whip
As a kid I was playing tag, now I'm it!
For those of ya'll that don't remember me
I'm a detroit old parker
Went from no office to offers
I told ya'll I would get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don't really need to own my city
Just as long as the d is on my fitted
My sons and my daughter and my wife is along for the ride

Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

gordon lightfoot,cold hands from new york,"I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
But I was young and able
When I came out the other end
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
Unreadable
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white, a face of brown
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
For a stranger
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, 'Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me'
I came down to live alone in New York
The city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
Were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died
Where no one knew them
Beause they couldn't win
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
Where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
Or if it mattered what they did
Or if they lived
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, 'Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me'
I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
And there were prophets in the squares
And people there who smiled and said, 'Forget it'
There were lovers in the park
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it
And there were preachers of the Word and poets
Who were never heard, I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn
The measure of the lie they're livin'
I heard a young musician play in a place
Where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
And offered their best wishes
That's how it is
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, 'Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me'

On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night
Her long flowing hair came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget
Then left with the answer I've never found yet
'How long', said she, 'Can a moment like this
Belong to someone?'
'What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die
We must almost be born'

the shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim,

And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
and in the night we'll wish this never ends.
We'll wish this never ends.

I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Lying here no fear in the darkness

Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin', head buried in the sand.
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ship sailing.
Groucho, with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing.
Klu Klux Klan serve hot soul food and the band plays 'In the Mood'
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand, there's a smell of
Peach blossom and bitter almonde.
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade, he know in a scent,
You can bottle all you made.

Smoking Winston Cigarettes.

Reveals his home amidst the streets.
Subway sounds, the sounds of complaint
The smell of acid on his gun of paint.
As it carves out anger in a blood-red band,
Destroyed tomorrow by an unknown hand;
My home.
Is this the way out from this endless scene?
Or just an entrance to another dream?
And the light dies down on Broadway.
But as the skylight beckons him to leave,
He hears a scream fro far below.
Within the raging water, writhes the form
Of brother John, he cries for help.
The gate is fading now, but open wide,
But John is drowning, I must decide
Between the freedom I had in the rat-race,
Or to stay forever in this forsaken place;
Hey John!
He makes for the river and the gate is gone,
Back to the void where it came from.

It's the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.

Drugstore takes down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
But the gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,
There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.

Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,

cab calloway,the man from harlem,"It was up at Mike's the other night,
There was really quite a sight,
Gather round, folks, while I give you all the lowdown.
Tables were filled with bloody frails,
Chewing on their fingernails;
They were waiting for the man from Harlem.
Drinks were served six bits a throw,
Things were moving kind of slow,
Everybody's nerves were getting jumpy.
All at once the room was still,
Men forgot all about their bill,
Who should enter but the man from Harlem.
Everybody rolled their eyes,
Women starting heaving sighs,
Someone hollered, Music, lights and gin,
Everybody cleared a space,
They had big, broad smiles on every face,
How they all loved to see the man from Harlem.
When he started in to step
He filled everyone with plenty pep,
He twitched and squirmed; it just was a dirty shame.
Everyone was in a daze,
Women watched him with amaze,
Each one said she'd have the man from Harlem.
He looked over in the corner,
And saw a couple of frails
And they sure did look kinda low.
Another cat walked up, and said to the man from Harlem,
Go over there and see what's the matter with them girls.
And they said, I'm kinda low.
And he said, I've got just what you need:
Come on, sisters, light up on these weeds and get high
And forget about everything",,

Packed up a picnic and set off for the sea,
Taking all the back roads where no-one else would be,
My and you and Paul and Sue,
How we laughed the time away,
And we had a perfect day.
I brought along my old guitar,
And lying there beneath the stars,
We sang all the Beatle songs we knew,
Lord you should have heard those harmonies,
When we did Nowhere Man and Let It Be
My love, if we should break up,
Should we ever part,
And you're searching for some memory,
To help your aching heart,
Forget about the hurtful things,
That lovers often say,
And remember this perfect day.
Then people start coming around the fire,
And I was strumming at my old guitar,
Trying to think of something everybody knew,
And then you said 'though it's far away,
A Christmas song would really make my day.'
And everybody sang
And all I really want to do,
Is sing songs for you,

chris de burgh,last night,"Last night I was walking through the harbor,
Where the fishing boats are lying on the shore,
The news had traveled fast and everyone went to be,
Where the mayor was making a speech,
And the crowd started cheering,
When he talked about the glory of it all,
And the boys coming home from the war;
Last night, they were dancing in the streets,
And making music in the alleyways and bars,
From a house down in the old town came the sound of guitars,
Margarita was waiting inside,
With her long black hair hanging down beneath the red light,
And she smiled, for the boys coming home from the war,
The boys coming home from the war;
And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
And we said 'nothing will make us change in any way,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,
Since yesterday, nothing has changed,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,'
But I can feel there's a new kind of hunger inside,
To be satisfied, I saw it there last night;
Last night I was walking through the shadows,
Far away from all the music and the girls,
When I saw a soldier waiting with a woman in black,
And they stood without any word,
Just staring at a photograph of someone, and she began to cry,
For a boy left behind in the war,
Some boy left behind in the war;",,

ani difranco,self evident,"Yes,
Us people are just poems
We're ninety percent metaphor
With a leanness of meaning
Approaching hyper-distillation
And once upon a time
We were moonshine
Rushing down the throat of a giraffe
Yes, rushing down the long hallway
Despite what the p.a. announcement says
Yes, rushing down the long hall
Down the long stairs
In a building so tall
That it will always be there
Yes, it's part of a pair
There on the bow of Noah's ark
The most prestigious couple
Just kickin' back parked
Against a perfectly blue sky
On a morning beatific
In its Indian summer breeze
On the day that America
Fell to its knees
After strutting around for a century
Without saying thank you
Or please
And the shock was subsonic
And the smoke was deafening
Between the setup and the punch line
Cause we were all on time for work that day
We all boarded that plane for to fly
And then while the fires were raging
We all climbed up on the window sill
And then we all held hands
And jumped into the sky
And every borough looked up when it heard the first blast
And then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed
And the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar
Looked more like war than anything I've seen so far
So far
So far
So fierce and ingenious
A poetic specter so far gone
That every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling
Over 'oh my god' and 'this is unbelievable' and on and on
And I'll tell you what, while we're at it
You can keep the pentagon
Keep the propaganda
Keep each and every tv
That's been trying to convince me
To participate
In some prep school punk's plan to perpetuate retribution
Perpetuate retribution
Even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution
Is still hanging in the air
And there's ash on our shoes
And there's ash in our hair
And there's a fine silt on every mantle
From hell's kitchen to Brooklyn
And the streets are full of stories
Sudden twists and near misses
And soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters
With tales of narrowly averted disasters
And the whiskey is flowin'
Like never before
As all over the country
Folks just shake their heads
And pour
So here's a toast to all the folks that live in Palestine, Afghanistan,
Iraq, El Salvador
Here's a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation
Under the stone cold gaze of Mt. Rushmore
Here's a toast to all those nurses and doctors
Who daily provide women with a choice
Who stand down a threat the size of Oklahoma City
Just to listen to a young woman's voice
Here's a toast to all the folks on death row right now
Awaiting the executioner's guillotine
Who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads
To find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream
Cause take away our PlayStations
And we are a third world nation
Under the thumb of some blue blood royal son
Who stole the oval office and that phony election
I mean
It don't take a weatherman
To look around and see the weather
Jeb said he'd deliver Florida, folks
And boy did he ever
And we hold these truths to be self evident:
Number one, George W. Bush is not president
Number two, America is not a true democracy
Number three, the media is not fooling me
Cause I am a poem heeding hyper-distillation
I've got no room for a lie so verbose
I'm looking out over my whole human family
And I'm raising my glass in a toast
Here's to our last drink of fossil fuels
May we vow to get off of this sauce
Shoo away the swarms of commuter planes
And find that train ticket we lost
Cause once upon a time the line followed the river
And peeked into all the backyards
And the laundry was waving
The graffiti was teasing us
From brick walls and bridges
We were rolling over ridges
Through valleys
Under stars
I dream of touring like Duke Ellington
In my own railroad car
I dream of waiting on the tall blond wooden benches
In a grand station aglow with grace
And then standing out on the platform
And feeling the air on my face
Give back the night its distant whistle
Give the darkness back its soul
Give the big oil companies the finger finally
And relearn how to rock-n-roll
Yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there
So it's time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets
And clear the air
Get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand
Of someone else's desert
Put it back in its pants
And quit the hypocritical chants of
Freedom forever
Cause when one lone phone rang
In two thousand and one
At ten after nine
On nine one one
Which is the number we all called
When that lone phone rang right off the wall
Right off our desk and down the long hall
Down the long stairs
In a building so tall
That the whole world turned
Just to watch it fall
And while we're at it
Remember the first time around?
The bomb?
The Ryder truck?
The parking garage?
The princess that didn't even feel the pea?
Remember joking around in our apartment on Avenue D?
Can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design
Following a fantastical reversal of the New York skyline?!
It was a joke
At the time
And that was just a few years ago
So let the record show
That the FBI was all over that case
That the plot was obvious and in everybody's face
And scoping that scene
Religiously
The CIA
Or is it KGB?
Committing countless crimes against humanity
With this kind of eventuality
As its excuse
For abuse after expensive abuse
And it didn't have a clue
Look, another window to see through
Way up here
On the hundredth and fourth floor
Look
Another key
Another door
Ten percent literal
Ninety percent metaphor
Three thousand some poems disguised as people
On an almost too perfect day
Must be more than pawns
In some asshole's passion play
So now it's your job
And it's my job
To make it that way
To make sure they didn't die in vain

ani difranco,two little girls,"you were fresh off the boat
from virginia
i had a year of new york city
under my belt
we met in a dream
we were both nineteen
i remember where we were standing
i remember how it felt
two little girls
growing out of their training bras
this little girl breaks furniture
this little girl breaks laws
two girls together
just a little less alone
this little girl cried wee wee wee
all the way home
you were always half crazy
now look at your baby
you make as much sense
as a nursery rhyme
love is a piano
dropped from a fourth story window
and you were in the wrong place
at the wrong time
and i don't like your girlfriend
i blame her
i never seen one of your lovers
do you so much harm
i loved you first
and you know i would prefer
if she didn't empty her syringes
into your arm
here comes little naked me
padding up to the bathroom door
to find little naked you
slumped on the bathroom floor
with my back against the wall
while you distill your whole life
down to a 911 call
now you bring me your bruises
so i can 'ooh' and 'aah' at the display
maybe i'm supposed to make one of my famous jokes
that makes everything okay
or maybe i'm supposed to be the handsome prince
who rides up and unties your hands
or maybe i'm the furrow-browed friend
who thinks she understands
here comes little naked me
padding up to the bathroom door
to find little naked you
slumped on the bathroom floor
so i guess i'll just stand here
with my back against the wall
while you distill your whole life
down to a 911 call",,

Underneath the corporate canopy
Where the sun
Rarely
Filters
Down
The ground
Is not so soft
Not so soft
They build buildings to house people
Making money
Or they build buildings to make money
Off of housing people
It's true
Like a lot of things are true
I am foraging for a phone booth on the forest floor
That is not so soft
I look up
It looks like the buildings are burning
But it's just the sun setting in the window
The solar system calling an end
To another business day
Eternally circling signally
The rhythmic clicking on and off
Of computers
The pulse
Of the american machine
The pulse
That draws death dancing
Out of anonymous side streets
You know
The ones that always get dumped on
And never get plowed
It draws death dancing
Out of little countries
With funny languages
Where the ground is getting harder
And it was
Not
That
Soft
Before
Those who call the shots
Are never in the line of fire
Why
Where there's life for hire
Out there
If a flag of truth were raised
We could watch every liar
Rise to wave it
Here
We learn america like a script
Playwright
Birthright
Same thing
We bring
Ourselves to the role
We're all rehearsing for the presidency
I always wanted to be
Commander in chief
Of my one woman army
But I can envision the mediocrity
Of my finest hour
It's the failed america in me
It's the fear that lives
In a forest of stone
Underneath the corporate canopy
Where the sun

Play out a scene they've played
So many times before
I am watching the sun stumble home in the morning
From a bar on the east side of town
And the coffee is just water dressed in brown
Beautiful but boring
He visited me yesterday
He noticed my fingers
And asked me if I would play
I didn't really care a lot
But I couldn't think of a reason why not
I said if you don't come any closer I don't mind if you stay
My thighs have been involved in many accidents
And now I can't get insured
And I don't need to be lured by you
My cunt is built like a wound that won't heal
And now you don't have to ask
Because you know how I feel
You know how I feel
Art is why I get up in the morning
But my definition ends there
And it doesn't seem fair
That I'm living for something I can't even define
There you are right there
In the meantime
I don't want to play for you anymore
Show me what you can do
Tell me what are you here for

I want my old face
I want my old mind

It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road to water

And back in the city
The sun bakes the trash on the curb
The men are pissing in doorways
And the rats run in herds
I've got a dream with your face in it
That scares me awake
I put too much on my table
And now I got too much a stake
And I might let you off easy
Yeah I might lead you on
I might wait for you to look for me
And then I might be gone
Where I come from and where I'm going
And I'm lost in between
I might go up to that phone booth
And leave a veiled invitation on you machine

The one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying 'let's not ask what's next,
Or how, or why'
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
The door opens, the room winces
The housekeeper comes in without a warning
I squint at the muscular motel light
And say, hey good morning
As she jumps, her keys jingle
And she leaves as quickly as she came in
I roll over and taste the pillow with my grin
The sheets are twisted and damp
Well the heat is so great
And I swear I can feel the mattress
Sinking underneath your weight
Oh sleep is like a fever
And I'm glad when it ends

ani difranco,hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, 'My God, they killed them all'
Here comes the story of the hurricane
The man, the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see?
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
'I didn't do it,' he says, and he throws up his hands
'I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin'' he says, and he stops
'One of us had better call up the cops'
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, 'I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates'
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, 'Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead'
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, 'Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy'
Yes, here's the story of the hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
'Remember that murder that happened in a bar?'
'Remember you said you saw the getaway car?'
'You think you'd like to play ball with the law?'
'Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?'
'Don't forget that you are white'
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, 'I'm really not sure'
Cops said, 'A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman Jim'
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

Tweedle Dumb or Tweedle Dumber?
And who's gonna have the big
Blockbuster box office
This summer
How 'bout we put up a wall
Between the houses and the highway
And then you can go your way
And I can go my way
Except all the radios agree with all the TV's
And all the magazines agree with all the radios
And I keep hearing that same damn song
Everywhere I go
Maybe I should put a bucket over my head
And a marshmallow in each ear
And stumble around for another dumb numb week
For another hum drum hit song to appear

As in a record of an event
The event of people
Playing music in a room
Now everything is cross-marketing
It's about sunglasses and shoes
Or guns or drugs

We got it half-assed
We're digging up all the graves
And we're spitting on the past
And we can choose between the colors
Of the lipstick on the whores
'cause we know the difference
Between the font of twenty percent more
And the font of teriyaki
You tell me
How does that make you feel?
You tell me what's real
They say that alcoholics are always alcoholics
Even when they're dry as my lips for years
Even when they're stranded on a small desert island
With no place in two thousand miles to buy beer
And I wonder is he different
Is he different
Has he changed
What he's about
Or is he just a liar
With nothing to lie about
Am I headed for the same brick wall
Is there anything I can do
About anything at all
Except go back to that corner in Manhattan
And dig deeper
Dig deeper this time
Down beneath the impossible pain of our history
Beneath unknown bones
Beneath the bedrock of the mystery
Beneath the sewage system and the path train
Beneath the cobblestones and the water main
Beneath the traffic of friendships and street deals
Beneath the screeching of kamikaze cab wheels
Beneath everything I can think of to think about
Beneath it all
Beneath all get out
Beneath the good and the kind and the stupid and the cruel

Pulling from the jazz stacks cause it's Sunday
On the air is incense, sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems they're equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me I'm cooling in New York
I'm chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtime's extended and highly recommended
But early birds like me's up checking out the scene
The early worms jog, forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people, the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm it's like Hades transformed
On Sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted, just chill
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
Ye it's kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely
Am I my brother's keeper
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else, violence
But right here is the life, it's the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hip-hop's all around, the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing, so chill
Wake up, praying that the game's on
Maybe it's the Running Rebs, maybe it's the Knicks
Maybe it's a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii 5-0 or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now I'm chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope, dig it
Sunday's to relax
Sunday's to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the ? knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think ain't nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm, some Sartre, Camus
Mingus' Ah Um, damn Roach can drum
The DP's are life, there they go, here they come

And different dreams pursue
Fragments of those songs remain

Lighthouse shine in Quarter time
And guide me from this coast
In case I run around once more
And meet you or your ghost

A dream the river stole away

Echo through my aching heart and tell me you're still true

And there's girls like MAD at the bus stop

Fellas are laughin', gassin' the past hoe
Girl steps to me and pushes issue
That knot you got, is that money or tissue?
Feelin' on the bulge, thinkin' it's her own
I tell her that it's money and she should move on
She says she's pure from legs to her thighs
And we should talk over some Chinese and fries
I tell her to step, but hey that's the scene
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a Brooklyn Queen
We are looking for 'Brooklyn'
We are looking for the Brooklyn-Queens!
State the rhyme, borough of Brooklyn
Otherwise known as Crooklyn
Freaks fortify flesh with gold
Ears hang trunk, in a slave hold
Walk past, don't get the time of day
Played like suede, on a summer sway
Conversated, till I made her laugh
Said, 'I'm Pete Nice, you want my autograph?'
Oval Office closed as she heard this
She said, 'From third Bass? I could do this'
Listen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants
'Cause the Brooklyn Queen's a gold digger

Squared away with my digits and tonight's plans
When I feel a crab grab my right hand
Slapped her on the back, tried to calm her
Asking her, 'Now what's the reason for the drama?'
Her next move was straight out of textbook
'Haven't we met before?' Giving me a sex look
Yo Wisdom, your lyrics are in bad taste
So I'm forced to give you nothing but the Gas Face
You better go, for hoppin' on the cab or bus
'Cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous
But get this, ain't this a humdinger?
She stepped to a retard sportin' a four-finger ring
Somewhere in the skin tight jeans
I'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens

Carefully the Queen holds my scepter
Gettin' numb like a Derelict on scotch

Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world

And take care of your own

And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
Baby, I've changed, please come back
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody, somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear

He pinned his heart to his tuxedo it throbbed
And hissed like a rabid jewel.
From the back of the chapel cracked
And crystal our gaze locked in temptation.
A priest with a glass eye sang songs of christian desperation.
The flower girls were all sown up,
They're hanging from the rafters.
Showering your matrimony like a guillotine's laughter.
'dearly beloved we are gathered here to witness,
The sacred union of vibrancy and sickness...
Do you take this man with the diamond skin tie?
And when you are fucking him will you scream dollar signs?
Let me introduce you to a new phrase...
New york noose for a new york slave.'
Stained glass eyes wink through mother maty's navelscope...
Who's pupils are watching?
The priest's tongue slips out like a jackal.
Every eye in the audience spinning like a drill.
The groom plucks a key from the rapture tree
And opens her ribcage like a squealing armoire.
Her lungs and liver screaming mercy mercy mercy,
While they re arrange the wires in her heart.
I now pronounce you smiling like a grave,
I now pronounce you a new york slave.
Now every dripping chest wound is getting little guilt feelings,
What about your new life do you crave?
He's your ticket to fame but your his new york slave.",,

I was already evicted
When you say lie
Do you think I believe any thing

Walking over Brooklyn bridge
Cold again, Cold again

When you walked up
I was looking at the wrong map
And now I'm locked out
I will be back in familiar spots

Back alone before the end
Cold again, Cold again

george shearing,lullaby of birdland,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",,

No need to run, no need to hide
Just take a little taste and tell me, what do you see
'Cause tonight we're gonna drop a little NYC
Having some fun, well, all of us are
Everyone around you's gonna be a star
'Cause it's the best and the worst, and it's life out loud
Don't mind if I preach; don't want to get too proud

And then the phone rings
And it isn't you
It's just a friend of mine saying 'hey, what's the matter, man, I've got some puerto rican girls just dying to meet you'

Have a good old time

Sometimes when I'm far away I ask myself
Are you all right, are you okay
Sometimes I laugh out loud or to myself
Thinking about something funny you might say
When I'm far away
Do you call my name
This is something I need to know
When you call my name
Do you really think of me
Please won't you tell me yes or no
I'm thinking back on all the times I needed you
But knew somehow it was never meant to be
Then I have to ask myself just one more time
Was there ever once that you just needed me
When I'm far away
Do you call my name
This is something I need to know
When you call my name
Do you really think of me
Please won't you tell me yes or no
I guess all that's left to say is I'm proud of you
I hope that I'll see you again some day
And I know very well I'll be near you again
The time will come when I won't be too far away
When I'm far away
Do you call my name
This is something I need to know
When you call my name
Do you really think of me

On september twelfth right here
In front of waverly
But unfortunately
I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend
A drummer
He resembles george harrison of the beatles
But he wears his hair
Tied in a small bow at the back
I love him
But it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in brooklyn somewhere
And wears this white crash helmet
He has gold chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
Mary and mom and 'hell's angels'
I would gratefully appreciate it
If you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend
And please
Tell him angela and I don't want the two dollars back
Just him

I'm wearing second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second hand Rose
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls
I'm wearing second hand curls

When you were a girl
The kind of things that come to those who wait
So give it a rest girl

And it's been falling all day long

What could I do

To play for you
And late December
Can drag a man down
You feel it deep in your gut
Short days and afternoons spent pottering around
In a dark house with the windows painted shut
Remember New York
Staring outside
As reckless winter made its way
From Staten Island to the Upper West Side
Whiting out our streets along the way
And the snow is coming down
On our New England town
And it's been falling all day long

Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders

Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
You know we're thorough in the boroughs 'cause that's a must
I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIX
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves

Sneakin' in at four am after going out

From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From ten-ten WINS to Live At Five

Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Lifelong, we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 9-11 we're still livin'
And lovin' life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us
We lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust
Dear New York I know a lot has changed
Two towers down but you're still in the game
Home to the many, rejecting no-one
Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from

Outside it was rainin',
You said you couldn't be stayin,
And you went back to your flowers and your birds.

Must eventually melt and fade,

If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York!
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York!
One hand in the air for the big city,
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

Manhattan squeezin' off, from cats who tease with war

Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra

golden earring,42nd street,"Spiraling leapers, wearing Nike sneakers
Some of them laugh, some of them sing
Some of them don't do a goddamn thing
Trip-skipping drifters, grafters and lifters
Chicks with big tits, school boys with zits
Moonlight circus of earthly delights
Pimpmobile cruising the soft velvet night
Deals going down, midnight in town
Down into the subways, the underground tunnels
A musician is playing, a drunk stumbles and mumbles
Out in the park it's scary with frights
Somebody shot out all the streetlights
Hookers and bookies, floozies and boozers
All kinds of misfits, perverts and losers
Out of the limo that looks like a boat
The pimp steps out in a mink fur coat
Sporting a Fedora, that creates its own aura
A ruby-tooth grin and a diamond stick pin
A deal's going down this side of town
People walk on fleet feetOn the way down 42nd Street
Except for the bums, down for the count
That one's dead but no one's found out
And look at the bitch, with her dress up ass
When she moves that thing, she must move it fast
Cop with a nightstick, checking around
A neon lit junkie slides to the ground
Here comes a flasher, a jogger, a punk
Check out that guy, drunk as a skunk
Blinking, reflection, lights melt in the rain
The sidewalks are empty, nothing's the same
4 A.M. people are crashing
Where the hookers are huddled
Colored raindrops are splashing
The deals have gone down, the bimbo's split town
Burned from the hustle, burned from the hype

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",,

What up, yeah (Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
Suuuuuuuu, aiyo, man, the wait is over
Pop your fu*kin....
[Chorus 2X: Method Man, Raekwon]
You better, watch your, muthafu*kin' mouth
It's just wolves with beats
You clown n*ggas can't rule the streets, we send shot
Wu-Tang, we rule the east, taking over the block

Aiyo, aiyo, straight funky and polly, blue X 'liro
They lookin' for me, what the fu*k you behind me for?
Stressin' everything I breathe on
I'm from a boulevard where n*ggas get jabbed and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lizards in grasses
You try to get me come-up on, yo
And when you see me, you know I got my come-up arm on
Cartier called me up, rob me
Yeah, we got your seed in the back of the Beemer, starving
We like lion killas, catch me on stage with the gauge in my right hand
Grenade in his leather bomber
I scalp money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coffin ya'll corner rappers, don't ever walk up on me
I write with only a safe Malcolm
Jeans getting muddy from clap with him

My first gun was a .32, right before *ugh*
Graduated to the .38, maybe a 9
I prefer the .45, stay live, techs held the crack gate in '88
AR spit from far, the best tenth, camouflage vet, reppin' the set
We on the east wing, Trini' ting, sexy bad
We up at Spring, with that thing thing
My crew strong, we take no search
Or your party done, you know how it run
Spray places, covered faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fu*k out
Keep it ninja, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any muthafu*kin' contender
[Method Man]
Garbage, ya time's up, go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, setting the grind up
Probably shoving them pies up, my rims is shined up
Wu, we on the rise up, spots supplied up
Plotting to get you wind up, box, then find her
Scratch, we got 'em sized up, and when the east is in the house
You, you, you, you, you

[Ghostface Killah]
On the side of the projects, gray skully
Bubble 'lo goose, mack 11 tucked in front of the belt
Prestigious moves, I'm killin' 'em, hoes, I'm drillin' 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin' 'em
In the van, 45's and dealy's, ready to slam
A house arrest box is going off, Toney got grams
Got a bathtub full of white, lay it in like sand
Montana Tone about to blow, ya'll cowards like fans
[Inspectah Deck]
This is boulevard hard, larger than your black car
Camouflage rap guard, I stomp the yard
I.N.S. spit monster bars, split, long cigars
My click dodge, bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like, Tim off the glass, spreading my name
I'm like the Pres, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all they cash, I'm so Wu
So new, that I ain't rip off the tags
[U-God]
RZA done birthed us, some cursed us on purpose
I'm the Grouch, my mouth is a circus
Earner, plus a good learner, don't need the hood
All I needs a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Back room's full of goons, with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang) more exhaust, tomahawk, cruise missile, just launch
[RZA]
Bzzz, out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You being dragged across the floor, round your jaw with my hook
Lyrical juks, five mil', the deal, off the books
Steve Rif' gave the nod, the Universal good look
Still spit poison venom, red monkey and Wu denim
Had honeydew suits, caramel sundae, all in 'em
[GZA]
Put my Clan in Da Front, reunite 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
You can roll as a whole, and they'll send you back in fractions
Break beat fanatic, with crates deep in attics
The Abbott pull out the 45, loop the static
I scroll through the menu then, roll to the venue
The dress code is armor, or get a hole up in you",,

He don't care if I freeze to death or not!

Ahh every thing's alright.
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,

And the good folk just got up.

Well, I can tell you now that it won't be me
Because my girlfriend's waiting patiently
And I have noticed that you're inclined to tease
So don't make this any harder for me please
Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?
You kissed me once and you got a response, and I know
After a kiss like that some men would leave their wife
But I don't want to destroy my life
Just because you look at me that way
It doesn't mean that I'm about to stay
But I can hardly believe
That I'm about to just leave
Because some weird chromosome
Somewhere deep inside is calling me home
Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?
Of course I want to share your bed with you
But if I stay tonight I can never go home

dar williams,hudson,"If we're lucky we feel our lives
Know when the next scene arrives
So often we start in the middle and work our way out
we go to some Grey sky diner for eggs and toast
New York Times or the New York Post
Then we take a ride through the valley of the shadow of death
But even for us New Yorkers, there's a time in every day
The river takes our breath away
[Chorus:]
And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own
The river roads collect the tolls
For the passage of our souls
Through silence, over woods, through flowers and snow
And past the George Washington Bridge
Down from the trails of Breakneck Ridge
The river's ancient path is sacred and slow
And as it swings through Harlem,
It's every shade of blue
Into the city of the new brand new
And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own
I thought I had no sense of place or past
Time was too slow, but then too fast
The river takes us home at last
Where and when does the memory take hold
Mountain range in the Autumn cold
And I thought West Point was Camelot in the spring
If you're lucky you'll find something that reflects you
Helps you feel your life protects you
Cradles you and connects you to everything
This whole life I remember as they begged them to itself
Never turn me into someone else

dar williams,spring street,"I'm sorry that I left you
With your questions all alone
But I was too happy driving
And too angry to drive home
I was thinking about the easy courage
Of my distant friends
They said I could let this bridge wash out
And never make amends
Can I blow this small town
Make a big sound
Like the star of a film noir postcard
Can I just forget the frames I shared with you
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can change my mind
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
Floating on their neon stems
There are new shirts on the clothes racks
Should I feel like one of them
I can find a small apartment
Where a struggling artist died
And pretend because I pay the rent
I know that pain inside
Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
Take the best part
Write it in your caffeine diary
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can leave tonight
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
This year April had a blizzard
Just to show she did not care
And the new dead leaves
They made the trees look like children with gray hair
But I'll push myself up through the dirt
And shake my petals free
I'm resolved to being born
And so resigned to bravery
Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
Houses floating, love is like that
We built on the river
And that's to say, yeah I'm leaving
But I don't have to go there
I don't have to go to Spring Street
'Cause it's spring everywhere...",,

Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

The bridge is over, the bridge is over
You see me come inna de dance wid de spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well, you must see me
Ya can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl dem-a-rhymin like they gay
Pickin up the mic, mon, dem don't know what to say
Saying that hip-hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, mon, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them agaaain
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to te-ell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it, and Queens keeps on faking it
Di-di di-da, di di-di, dida di-day, aiy!
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play, cause
Here's an example of KRS-One, bo!
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP, but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock
Cause we don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions comes in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said 'I tell you now, you ain't nothing'
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now mon
To KRS-One you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
This name of this routine is called 'Live At Union Square'
Square, square, square, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't know you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking bout your wack Puma sneaker
Cause Bronx created hip-hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking bout the Juice Crew
Funny, but you're still telling lies to me",,
boogie down productions,my philosophy,"Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, 'Who is more dramatical?'
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk, and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, 'My Philosophy'
Number one, was 'Poetry' you know it's me
This is 'My Philosophy,' many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning, and learn to earn respect
Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style, and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't, cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just seckle!
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, cos I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me tell you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MC's be talking and talking
Trying to show how black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken english and drug selling
See I'm telling, and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy, on the industry
Don't bother dissing me, or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute, or commercialize all the lyrics
Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call Hip Hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody says, 'Don't f*** with Kris!'
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny - that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher
It's not about a salary it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?!
I say yo, what's up, it's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With Criminal Minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home, and start sweating
Why? Well it's simple, to them it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me
Or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock
But they can get bust get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around nor do I F around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sounds? a little unrational
A lot of emcees like to use the word dramatical!
Fresh for '88, you suckers",,
boogie down productions,south bronx,"Yo what's up Blastmaster KRS One, this jam is kicking
Word, yo what up D-Nice?
(Yo what's up Scott La Rock?)
Yo man we chilling just funky fresh jam
I want to tell you a little something about us
We're the Boogie Down Productions crew
And due to the fact that no-one else out there knew what time it was
We have to tell you a little story about where we we come from
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
Many people tell me this style is terrific
It is kinda different but let's get specific
KRS-One specialize in music
I'll only use this type of style when I choose it
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attack
Ya got dropped off MCA cause the rhymes you wrote was wack
So you think that hip-hop had its start out in Queensbridge
If you pop that junk up in the Bronx you might not live
Cause you're in
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
I came with Scott La Rock to express one thing
I am a teacher and others are kings
If that's the title they earn, well it's well deserved, but
Without a crown, see, I still burn
You settle for a pebble not a stone like a rebel
KRS-One is the holder of a boulder, money folder
You want a fresh style let me show ya
Now way back in the days when hip-hop began
With Coke LaRock, Kool Herc, and then Bam
Beat boys ran to the latest jam
But when it got shot up they went home and said 'Damn
There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day
B-boys getting blown away but coming outside anyway'
They tried again outside in Cedar Park
Power from a street light made the place dark
But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
Remember Bronx River, rolling thick
With Kool DJ Red Alert and Chuck Chillout on the mix
When Afrika Islam was rocking the jams
And on the other side of town was a kid named Flash
Patterson and Millbrook projects
Casanova all over, ya couldn't stop it
The Nine Lives Crew, the Cypress Boys
The real Rock Steady taking out these toys
As odd as it looked, as wild as it seems
I didn't hear a peep from a place called Queens
It was seventy-six to 1980
The dreads in Brooklyn was crazy
You couldn't bring out your set with no hip-hop
Because the pistols would go
So why don't you wise up, show all the people in the place that you are wack
Instead of tryna take out LL, you need to take your homeboys off the crack
Cause if you don't, well, then their nerves will become shot
And that would leave the job up to my own Scott La Rock
And he's from
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
The human TR-808, D-Nice
The poet, the Blastmaster KRS-ONE
The Grand Incredible DJ Scott La Rock

Time and time again, as I pick up the pen
As my thoughts emerge, these are those words
I glance at the paper to know what's going on
Someone's doing wrong, the story goes on
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
The drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
I look, but it doesn't coincide with my books
Social studies will not speak upon political crooks
It's just the presidents, and all the money they spent
All the things they invent, and how their house is so immaculate
They create missiles, my family's eating gristle
Then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
Phone calls are made, profiles are kept low
You tamper with some jobs, now the press is controlled
Not only newspapers, but every single station
You only get to hear the president is on vacation
But uh, stay calm, there's no need for alarm
You say goodbye to your mom, and you're off to Vietnam
You shoot to kill, come back and you're a veteran
But how many veterans are out there pedaling?
There's no telling, cause they continue selling
As quiet as it's kept, I won't go into depth
You could talk about Nigeria, people used to laugh at ya
Now I take a look, I see USA For Africa?
Huh
What's the solution, to stop all this confusion?
Rewrite the constitution, change the drug which you're using
Rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
We fight inflation, yet the president's still on vacation

This might sound a little strange to you
Well here's the reason I came to you
We gotta put our heads together, and stop the violence
Cause real bad boys move in silence
When you're in a club, you come to chill out
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
That's what these other people want to see
Another race fight endlessly
You know we're being watched, you know we're being seen
Some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
But I won't drop
Not I or Scott LaRock
Well here is the message that we bring today
Hip-hop will surely decay
If we as a people don't stand up and say
Stop the violence
One two three, the crew is called BDP
And if you want to go to the tip top
Stop the violence in Hip Hop, Y-O
BDP and me
We step into the party top celebrity
Say when we come in the dance, we never have to pay a fee
Cause that's cos we got R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I have this one wife, her name is Miss Melody
Although I'm from the Bronx, she from the Brooklyn posse
I tell ya a little of this and then I tell you some of that
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wear a hat
Sometimes I'm in a Mercedes and sometimes I'm in a plane
Sometimes I find myself upon the number two train
Some people look at me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself I see creativity
So if I can create, well then I make some money
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid
