modern times,al stewart,60,0,Hello old friend, what a strange coincidence to find you
modern times,al stewart,60,1,It's been fifteen years since we last met, but I still recognised you
modern times,al stewart,60,2,So call the barman over here, and let us fill our glasses
modern times,al stewart,60,3,And drink a toast to olden times where all our memories lie
modern times,al stewart,60,4,Where all our memories lie
modern times,al stewart,60,5,Do you remember the time we were young?
modern times,al stewart,60,6,Lowly, lowly, low
modern times,al stewart,60,7,Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung
modern times,al stewart,60,8,On the midnight snow
modern times,al stewart,60,9,So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night
modern times,al stewart,60,10,Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright
modern times,al stewart,60,11,Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light
modern times,al stewart,60,12,It all comes back like yesterday
modern times,al stewart,60,13,It almost seems like yesterday
modern times,al stewart,60,14,Do you remember the changes as we grew?
modern times,al stewart,60,15,Slowly, slowly, slow
modern times,al stewart,60,16,Sneaking in the back way into movies after school
modern times,al stewart,60,17,For the evening show
modern times,al stewart,60,18,Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site
modern times,al stewart,60,19,Checking out the dance floor while the band played "Hold Me Tight"
modern times,al stewart,60,20,See the blonde one over there: I bet she'd be alright
modern times,al stewart,60,21,It all comes back like yesterday
modern times,al stewart,60,22,It almost seems like yesterday
modern times,al stewart,60,23,While I talked he sat and he never made a sound
modern times,al stewart,60,24,Staring at the glass beside me
modern times,al stewart,60,25,Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?
modern times,al stewart,60,26,Silence grows on you like ivy
modern times,al stewart,60,27,Ivy
modern times,al stewart,60,28,Do you remember the church across the sands?
modern times,al stewart,60,29,Holy, holy, ho
modern times,al stewart,60,30,You stood outside and planned to travel the lands
modern times,al stewart,60,31,Where the pilgrims go
modern times,al stewart,60,32,So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack
modern times,al stewart,60,33,Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac
modern times,al stewart,60,34,Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back
modern times,al stewart,60,35,Tell me why you look away
modern times,al stewart,60,36,Don't you have a word to say?
modern times,al stewart,60,37,He said, "I don't remember ... I Don't want to remember
modern times,al stewart,60,38,In fact I've heard too much already
modern times,al stewart,60,39,I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink
modern times,al stewart,60,40,Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City
modern times,al stewart,60,41,Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know
modern times,al stewart,60,42,And you just don't understand me
modern times,al stewart,60,43,I've got no use for the tricks of modern times
modern times,al stewart,60,44,They tangle all my thoughts like ivy
modern times,al stewart,60,45,Ivy"
modern times,al stewart,60,46,So I left him, and I went out to the street
modern times,al stewart,60,47,Lowly, lowly, low
modern times,al stewart,60,48,Where the red light girls were coming after me
modern times,al stewart,60,49,Forty dollar show
modern times,al stewart,60,50,All across the city's heart the lights were coming on
modern times,al stewart,60,51,The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song
modern times,al stewart,60,52,If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone
modern times,al stewart,60,53,A picture-card of yesterday
modern times,al stewart,60,54,A photograph of yesterdayAnd far off in a deserted part of town
modern times,al stewart,60,55,The shadows like a silent army
modern times,al stewart,60,56,Flooded out the rooms in pools of blue and brown
modern times,al stewart,60,57,And stuck to all the walls like ivy
modern times,al stewart,60,58,Ivy
modern times,al stewart,60,59,Ivy
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,0,You told the man in the Broadway Hotel
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,1,Nothing was stranger than being yourself
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,2,And he replied, with a tear in his eye
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,3,Love was a rollaway
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,4,Just a cajole away
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,5,Mist on a summer's day
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,6,Nothing was clear
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,7,Love was a smile away
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,8,Just a defile away
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,9,I sought it every way
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,10,No one came near.
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,11,You asked the man for a room with a view
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,12,Nothing was said as he stared at his shoe
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,13,Then he replied as he gave you the key
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,14,Love was a rollaway
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,15,Just an unfold away
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,16,That's all there is to say
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,17,No one came near.
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,18,Alone in your room you hide
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,19,As the night rolls by
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,20,In the street outside
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,21,And you feel over the words he said
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,22,Till they turn to rain all around your head
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,23,You're seeking a hideaway
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,24,Where the light of day
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,25,Doesn't touch your face
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,26,And a door sign keeps the world away
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,27,Behind the shades
broadway hotel,al stewart,29,28,Of your silent day.
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,0,Oh I come from Pittsburgh to study astrology
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,1,She said as she stepped on my instep
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,2,I could show you New York with a walk between Fourth Street and Nine
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,3,Then out of her coat taking seven harmonicas
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,4,She sat down to play on a doorstep
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,5,Saying, Come back to my place I will show you the stars and the signs
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,6,So I followed her into the black lands
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,7,Where the window frames peel and flake
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,8,And the old Jewish face behind the lace
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,9,Even now trying to get to see what's cooking
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,10,Just John the Baptist in the park getting laid thinking there's no-one looking
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,11,And its eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,12,Her house was a dusty collection of rusty
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,13,Confusion with landings and tunnels
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,14,And leaning bookcases and spaces and faces and things
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,15,Where twenty-five Puerto Ricans, Manhattan Mohicans
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,16,And Jewish-Italian Pawnbrokers
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,17,Lead their theatrical lives in their rooms in the wings
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,18,While outside in the black lands
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,19,The violent day runs wild
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,20,And the black and white minstrels run through the crazy
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,21,Alleys while the cops go booking
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,22,And ruthless toothless agents sneak around and there's no-one looking
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,23,And it's eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,24,And oh, I'm back in the city again
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,25,You can tell by the smell of the hamburger stand in the rain
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,26,She spoke of astrology while muttering apologies
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,27,For coffee that tasted of hot dogs
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,28,I said, That's OK, mine was cold anyway, and just grand
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,29,Then she lay on the bed while the radio fed
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,30,Us with records and adverts for cat food
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,31,And I looked at her, holding my thoughts in the palm of my hand
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,32,And outside in the black lands
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,33,The evening came and went
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,34,And the bums in the street begging money for one last drink
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,35,Are hanging round the liquor stores trying to get a foot in
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,36,And the girl from Pittsburgh and I made love on a mattress with the new moon looking
in brooklyn,al stewart,38,37,And in the cool evening breeze I was down on my knees in Brooklyn
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,0,Take a flight to London, sing my song
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,1,Bring me back to New York, that's where I get paid
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,2,Dance with the ladies all night long
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,3,Take a train to Brooklyn tryin' to get laid
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,4,I see you're walkin' away
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,5,Don't be afraid I won't bite hard
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,6,It's better than being alone
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,7,Black out in Brooklyn I'm so hard
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,8,Naked with lady, crashed my car
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,9,Maxed out all of my credit cards
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,10,Blacked out in Brooklyn, all night long
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,11,Brooklyn!
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,12,Heading out to Detroit got the call
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,13,The motor city's jumping
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,14,Maybe I should stay
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,15,Curtain call's coming, we'll have to stall
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,16,A red heads running away back stage
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,17,I see her coming this way
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,18,Don't be afraid I won't bite hard
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,19,It's better than being alone
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,20,Black out in Brooklyn I'm so hard
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,21,Naked with lady, crashed my car
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,22,Maxed out all of my credit cards
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,23,Blacked out in Brooklyn, all night long

brooklyn,buckcherry,34,25,I get in, I get out
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,26,Jump in a cab at a quarter to midnight

brooklyn,buckcherry,34,28,And the party gets started again
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,29,Blacked out in Brooklyn I'm so hard
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,30,Naked with lady, crashed my car
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,31,Maxed out all of my credit cards
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,32,Blacked out in Brooklyn, all night long
brooklyn,buckcherry,34,33,Brooklyn!

train under water,bright eyes,48,10,When I leave the village
train under water,bright eyes,48,11,So couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
train under water,bright eyes,48,12,But I sing glory from my lowest
train under water,bright eyes,48,13,And I will say peace
train under water,bright eyes,48,14,To the people I meet
train under water,bright eyes,48,15,While the world waits for an explosion
train under water,bright eyes,48,16,That instant of light that wipes the slate clean

train under water,bright eyes,48,22,It happened to me now it's happening to you
train under water,bright eyes,48,23,But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through
train under water,bright eyes,48,24,Well if I could tame all of my desires
train under water,bright eyes,48,25,Wait out the weather
train under water,bright eyes,48,26,That howls in my brain
train under water,bright eyes,48,27,Because it seems
train under water,bright eyes,48,28,That it's always changing
train under water,bright eyes,48,29,The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
train under water,bright eyes,48,30,Yeah, I was a postcard
train under water,bright eyes,48,31,I was a record
train under water,bright eyes,48,32,I was a camera
train under water,bright eyes,48,33,Until I went blind
train under water,bright eyes,48,34,Now I am riding all over this island

train under water,bright eyes,48,45,I mean, if I get sidetracked
train under water,bright eyes,48,46,It's only cause I wanted to
train under water,bright eyes,48,47,I'm keeping up with the moon on an all-night avenue
lua,bright eyes,39,0,I know that it is freezing
lua,bright eyes,39,1,But I think we have to walk
lua,bright eyes,39,2,Keep waving at the taxis
lua,bright eyes,39,3,They keep turning the lights on
lua,bright eyes,39,4,But Julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
lua,bright eyes,39,5,Supplies are endless in the evening
lua,bright eyes,39,6,By the morning they'll be gone
lua,bright eyes,39,7,And everything is lonely
lua,bright eyes,39,8,I can be my own best friend
lua,bright eyes,39,9,I get a coffee and the paper
lua,bright eyes,39,10,Have no phone conversations
lua,bright eyes,39,11,With the sidewalk and the pigeons
lua,bright eyes,39,12,And my window reflection
lua,bright eyes,39,13,When I start polishing in the evening
lua,bright eyes,39,14,By the morning looks like shit
lua,bright eyes,39,15,And I know you have a heavy heart
lua,bright eyes,39,16,I can feel it when we kiss
lua,bright eyes,39,17,So many men stronger than me
lua,bright eyes,39,18,Have thrown their backs out trying to live
lua,bright eyes,39,19,Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
lua,bright eyes,39,20,You can count on me to split
lua,bright eyes,39,21,But what I tell you in the evening
lua,bright eyes,39,22,By the morning won't make sense
lua,bright eyes,39,23,You looking skinny like a model
lua,bright eyes,39,24,With your eyes all painted black
lua,bright eyes,39,25,Just keep going to the bathroom
lua,bright eyes,39,26,Only say you'll be right back
lua,bright eyes,39,27,Well it takes one to know one kid
lua,bright eyes,39,28,I think you've got it bad
lua,bright eyes,39,29,But what's so easy in the evening
lua,bright eyes,39,30,By the morning it's such a drag
lua,bright eyes,39,31,Got a flask inside my pocket
lua,bright eyes,39,32,We can share it on the train
lua,bright eyes,39,33,And if you promise to stay conscious
lua,bright eyes,39,34,I'll try to do the same
lua,bright eyes,39,35,Well we might die from that medicine
lua,bright eyes,39,36,But we sure killed all the pain
lua,bright eyes,39,37,What was normal in the evening
lua,bright eyes,39,38,By the morning seems insane

lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,9,Have you thrown your senses to the war, or did you lose them in the flood?"
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,10,That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,11,Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,12,He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got "Bound for Glory" in red, white and blue flash paint
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,13,He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,14,Well, that blaze-and-noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,15,He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,16,And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell, that is, nothin' left that you could sell
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,17,Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,18,And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,19,I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm, or was he just lost in the flood?
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,20,Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,21,Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,22,And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,23,Everything stops, you hear five quick shots, the cops come up for air
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,24,And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,25,And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose, but he gets blown right off his feet
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,26,And some kid comes blastin' 'round the corner, but a cop puts him right away
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,27,He lays on the street holding his leg, screaming something in Spanish, still breathing when I walked away
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,28,And somebody said, "Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud"
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,29,I wonder what the dude was sayin', or was he just lost in the flood?
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,30,Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up
lost in the flood,bruce springsteen,32,31,I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?

this land is your land,bruce springsteen,20,4,I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
this land is your land,bruce springsteen,20,5,Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
this land is your land,bruce springsteen,20,6,And all around me a voice was calling

jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,0,The Rangers had a homecoming
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,1,In Harlem late last night
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,2,And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,3,Over the Jersey state line
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,4,Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,5,Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,6,The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,7,Together they take a stab at romance
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,8,And disappear down Flamingo Lane
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,9,Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,10,Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,11,And the kids 'round there live just like shadows
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,12,Always quiet, holding hands
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,13,From the churches to the jails
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,14,Tonight all is silence in the world
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,15,As we take our stand
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,16,Down in Jungleland
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,17,The midnight gang's assembled
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,18,And picked a rendezvous for the night
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,19,They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,20,That brings this fair city light
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,21,Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,22,There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,23,Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,24,The street's alive as secret debts are paid
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,25,Contacts made, they flash unseen
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,26,Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,27,Hustling for the record machine
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,28,The hungry and the hunted
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,29,Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,30,That face off against each other out in the street
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,31,Down in Jungleland
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,32,In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,33,Inside the backstreet girls are dancing
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,34,To the records that the DJ plays
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,35,Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,36,Desperate as the night moves on
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,37,Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,38,Beneath the city, two hearts beat
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,39,Soul engines running through a night so tender
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,40,In a bedroom locked in whispers
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,41,Of soft refusal and then surrender
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,42,In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,43,As shots echo down them hallways in the night
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,44,No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,45,Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,46,Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,47,Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,48,And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,49,They just stand back and let it all be
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,50,And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,51,And try to make an honest stand
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,52,But they wind up wounded, not even dead
jungleland,bruce springsteen,54,53,Tonight in Jungleland

the boxer,bob dylan,33,6,Still a man hears what he wants to hear
the boxer,bob dylan,33,7,And disregards the rest
the boxer,bob dylan,33,8,When I left my home and family
the boxer,bob dylan,33,9,I was no more than a boy
the boxer,bob dylan,33,10,In the company of strangers
the boxer,bob dylan,33,11,In the quiet of the railway station
the boxer,bob dylan,33,12,Running scared

joey,bob dylan,68,0,Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
joey,bob dylan,68,1,Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
joey,bob dylan,68,2,Always on the outside of whatever side there was
joey,bob dylan,68,3,When they asked him why it had to be that way, well, he answered, just because
joey,bob dylan,68,4,Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
joey,bob dylan,68,5,They called Joe Crazy, the baby they called Kid Blast
joey,bob dylan,68,6,Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too
joey,bob dylan,68,7,It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
joey,bob dylan,68,8,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,9,King of the streets, child of clay
joey,bob dylan,68,10,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,11,What made them want to come and blow you away
joey,bob dylan,68,12,There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
joey,bob dylan,68,13,No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
joey,bob dylan,68,14,When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost got hit the roof
joey,bob dylan,68,15,He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof
joey,bob dylan,68,16,Then, the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
joey,bob dylan,68,17,Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
joey,bob dylan,68,18,Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
joey,bob dylan,68,19,They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
joey,bob dylan,68,20,The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim
joey,bob dylan,68,21,Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame
joey,bob dylan,68,22,But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, we're not those kind of men
joey,bob dylan,68,23,It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again
joey,bob dylan,68,24,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,25,King of the streets, child of clay
joey,bob dylan,68,26,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,27,What made them want to come and blow you away
joey,bob dylan,68,28,The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
joey,bob dylan,68,29,They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
joey,bob dylan,68,30,What time is it? said the judge to Joey when they met
joey,bob dylan,68,31,Five to ten, said Joey, the judge says, that's exactly what you get
joey,bob dylan,68,32,He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
joey,bob dylan,68,33,They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike
joey,bob dylan,68,34,His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
joey,bob dylan,68,35,What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
joey,bob dylan,68,36,They let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
joey,bob dylan,68,37,But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
joey,bob dylan,68,38,He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
joey,bob dylan,68,39,To the boss he said, I have returned and now I want what's mine
joey,bob dylan,68,40,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,41,King of the streets, child of clay
joey,bob dylan,68,42,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,43,What made them want to come and blow you away
joey,bob dylan,68,44,It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
joey,bob dylan,68,45,I'm around too many children, he'd say, they should never know of one
joey,bob dylan,68,46,Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
joey,bob dylan,68,47,Emptied out the register, said, tell 'em it was Crazy Joe
joey,bob dylan,68,48,One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
joey,bob dylan,68,49,He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork
joey,bob dylan,68,50,He pushed the table over to protect his family
joey,bob dylan,68,51,Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy
joey,bob dylan,68,52,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,53,King of the streets, child of clay
joey,bob dylan,68,54,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,55,What made them want to come and blow you away
joey,bob dylan,68,56,Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
joey,bob dylan,68,57,I heard his best friend Frankie say, he ain't dead, he's just asleep
joey,bob dylan,68,58,Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
joey,bob dylan,68,59,I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
joey,bob dylan,68,60,The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
joey,bob dylan,68,61,They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
joey,bob dylan,68,62,And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve
joey,bob dylan,68,63,I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve
joey,bob dylan,68,64,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,65,King of the streets, child of clay
joey,bob dylan,68,66,Joey, Joey
joey,bob dylan,68,67,What made them want to come and blow you away

hurricane,bob dylan,99,11,I didn't do it, he says, and he throws up his hands
hurricane,bob dylan,99,12,I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
hurricane,bob dylan,99,13,I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
hurricane,bob dylan,99,14,One of us had better call up the cops
hurricane,bob dylan,99,15,And so Patty calls the cops
hurricane,bob dylan,99,16,And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
hurricane,bob dylan,99,17,In the hot New Jersey night
hurricane,bob dylan,99,18,Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
hurricane,bob dylan,99,19,Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
hurricane,bob dylan,99,20,Number one contender for the middleweight crown
hurricane,bob dylan,99,21,Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
hurricane,bob dylan,99,22,When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
hurricane,bob dylan,99,23,Just like the time before and the time before that
hurricane,bob dylan,99,24,In Paterson that's just the way things go
hurricane,bob dylan,99,25,If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
hurricane,bob dylan,99,26,'Less you want to draw the heat
hurricane,bob dylan,99,27,Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
hurricane,bob dylan,99,28,Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
hurricane,bob dylan,99,29,He said, I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
hurricane,bob dylan,99,30,They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates
hurricane,bob dylan,99,31,And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
hurricane,bob dylan,99,32,Cop said, wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead
hurricane,bob dylan,99,33,So they took him to the infirmary
hurricane,bob dylan,99,34,And though this man could hardly see
hurricane,bob dylan,99,35,They told him that he could identify the guilty men
hurricane,bob dylan,99,36,Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
hurricane,bob dylan,99,37,They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
hurricane,bob dylan,99,38,The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
hurricane,bob dylan,99,39,Says, wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!
hurricane,bob dylan,99,40,Here's the story of the Hurricane
hurricane,bob dylan,99,41,The man the authorities came to blame
hurricane,bob dylan,99,42,For somethin' that he never done
hurricane,bob dylan,99,43,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
hurricane,bob dylan,99,44,The champion of the world
hurricane,bob dylan,99,45,Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
hurricane,bob dylan,99,46,Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
hurricane,bob dylan,99,47,While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
hurricane,bob dylan,99,48,And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame
hurricane,bob dylan,99,49,Remember that murder that happened in a bar
hurricane,bob dylan,99,50,Remember you said you saw the getaway car
hurricane,bob dylan,99,51,You think you'd like to play ball with the law
hurricane,bob dylan,99,52,Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night
hurricane,bob dylan,99,53,Don't forget that you are white
hurricane,bob dylan,99,54,Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure
hurricane,bob dylan,99,55,The cops said a poor boy like you could use a break
hurricane,bob dylan,99,56,We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
hurricane,bob dylan,99,57,You don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
hurricane,bob dylan,99,58,You'll be doin' society a favor
hurricane,bob dylan,99,59,That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
hurricane,bob dylan,99,60,We want to put his ass in stir
hurricane,bob dylan,99,61,We want to pin this triple murder on him
hurricane,bob dylan,99,62,He ain't no Gentleman Jim
hurricane,bob dylan,99,63,Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
hurricane,bob dylan,99,64,But he never did like to talk about it all that much
hurricane,bob dylan,99,65,It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
hurricane,bob dylan,99,66,And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
hurricane,bob dylan,99,67,Up to some paradise
hurricane,bob dylan,99,68,Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
hurricane,bob dylan,99,69,And ride a horse along a trail
hurricane,bob dylan,99,70,But then they took him to the jailhouse
hurricane,bob dylan,99,71,Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
hurricane,bob dylan,99,72,All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
hurricane,bob dylan,99,73,The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
hurricane,bob dylan,99,74,The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
hurricane,bob dylan,99,75,To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
hurricane,bob dylan,99,76,And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
hurricane,bob dylan,99,77,No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
hurricane,bob dylan,99,78,And though they could not produce the gun
hurricane,bob dylan,99,79,The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
hurricane,bob dylan,99,80,And the all-white jury agreed
hurricane,bob dylan,99,81,Rubin Carter was falsely tried
hurricane,bob dylan,99,82,The crime was murder one, guess who testified
hurricane,bob dylan,99,83,Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
hurricane,bob dylan,99,84,And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
hurricane,bob dylan,99,85,How can the life of such a man
hurricane,bob dylan,99,86,Be in the palm of some fool's hand
hurricane,bob dylan,99,87,To see him obviously framed
hurricane,bob dylan,99,88,Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
hurricane,bob dylan,99,89,Where justice is a game
hurricane,bob dylan,99,90,Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
hurricane,bob dylan,99,91,Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
hurricane,bob dylan,99,92,While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
hurricane,bob dylan,99,93,An innocent man in a living hell
hurricane,bob dylan,99,94,That's the story of the Hurricane
hurricane,bob dylan,99,95,But it won't be over till they clear his name
hurricane,bob dylan,99,96,And give him back the time he's done
hurricane,bob dylan,99,97,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
hurricane,bob dylan,99,98,The champion of the world

the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,0,It's hell up in Harlem, my main man just caught a bad one
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,1,Wetted by a magnum when he didn't have none
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,2,That goes to show you that even when you're respected
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,3,Brothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,4,So I went uptown to get the low-down
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,5,To see who made the whole thing go down
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,6,Word on the streets had it
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,7,Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,8,Came to start static
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,9,Some new jacks at the game
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,10,Tryin' to get a name
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,11,Had a point to prove
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,12,Wrong move
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,13,So I can't wait to get em all straight
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,14,It's a big payback when I retaliate
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,15,Steam, I gotta let it off
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,16,And I can't wait to set it off
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,17,To revenge my main man that's gone
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,18,And as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,19,The beef is on
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,20,(Once again it's on)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,21,(You got beef)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,22,(Once again it's on)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,23,(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,24,It's time to show them how to get hard
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,25,Callin' a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,26,For tryin' to friddont and fiddake the middood
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,27,But when I get riddude awesome dude
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,28,So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,29,Bedstuy do or die is where I was lookin'
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,30,For my boys from roosevelt, albany and marcy
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,31,Plus I got a posse over in canarsie
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,32,I'm talkin' about ill brothers that don't play
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,33,They sit around watchin 'scarface' all day
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,34,So here we go, headed up to they scene
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,35,Twenty deep in a van like the a-team
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,36,We rolled up to see what this joint's about
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,37,When one of my boys in the van just pointed em out
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,38,So without delay we reacted
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,39,And started shootin' like it was target practice
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,40,When they saw that we wasn't messin' around
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,41,One tried to run, so I had to chase him down
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,42,I caught the kid by the corner store deli
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,43,Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,44,I did his jugular vein something violent
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,45,Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,46,We sent fifteen bodies to trapper john
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,47,Cos the beef was on

the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,51,(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,52,(I don't happen to trust people
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,53,I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,54,You'd mop the street up with me
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,55,And I got to kill a lot more of your people
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,56,To put you in your place)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,57,(You send your boys in I send em back in a paper bag)
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,58,Many screamed about a homicide
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,59,But when I came to shut em down all the drama died
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,60,I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,61,And we roll like the Corleone family
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,62,I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,63,In the aftermath everything's destroyed
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,64,Like a crew of barbarians
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,65,And brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,66,So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,67,Cos soon as I see ya, best believe I'ma call your bluff
the beef is on,big daddy kane,77,68,And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff

cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,0,I came down through Albany to New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,1,To find what I'd been missin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,2,I looked across the river to the city
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,3,Where the windows all stood glistenin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,4,I stood listenin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,5,Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,6,But I was young and able
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,7,When I came out the other end
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,8,Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,9,Unreadable
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,10,I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,11,I thanked him
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,12,A face of white, a face of brown
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,13,Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,14,For a stranger
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,15,It was too unreal for me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,16,I found no one who trusted me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,17,There was no man could offer me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,18,A cold hand from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,19,Cold hands from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,20,A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,21,I'll do the same for you one day
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,22,If you should ever pass my way and need me"
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,23,I came down to live alone in New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,24,The city of the living
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,25,There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,26,Were taking, none we giving
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,27,Or forgiving
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,28,Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,29,I saw them
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,30,There were men who lived in style and others who had died
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,31,Where no one knew them
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,32,Beause they couldn't win
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,33,There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,34,Where babies crept unwanted
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,35,Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,36,Or if it mattered what they did
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,37,Or if they lived
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,38,It was too unreal for me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,39,I found no one who trusted me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,40,There was no man could offer me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,41,A cold hand from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,42,Cold hands from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,43,A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me

cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,49,Where the windows all stood glistenin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,50,I stood listenin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,51,And there were prophets in the squares
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,52,And people there who smiled and said, "Forget it"
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,53,There were lovers in the park
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,54,And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,55,So afraid of it
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,56,And there were preachers of the Word and poets
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,57,Who were never heard, I heard them
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,58,There were those who would not try to learn
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,59,The measure of the lie they're livin'
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,60,I heard a young musician play in a place
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,61,Where they paid you not to listen
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,62,I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,63,And offered their best wishes
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,64,That's how it is
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,65,It was too unreal for me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,66,I found no one who trusted me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,67,There was no man could offer me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,68,A cold hand from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,69,Cold hands from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,70,A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me

cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,72,If you should ever pass my way and need me"
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,73,Cold hands from New York
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,74,A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
cold hands from new york,gordon lightfoot,81,75,I'll do the same for you one day

in the cage,genesis,75,0,I got sunshine in my stomach
in the cage,genesis,75,1,Like I just rocked my baby to sleep.
in the cage,genesis,75,2,I got sunshine in my stomach
in the cage,genesis,75,3,But I can't keep me from creeping sleep,
in the cage,genesis,75,4,Sleep, deep in the deep.
in the cage,genesis,75,5,He wakes in a cold sweat with a strong urge to vomit. There's no sign of the cocoon and he can see more of the cave about him. There is much more of the glowing water dripping from the roof and stalactites and stalagmites are forming and decomposing at an alarming rate all around him.
in the cage,genesis,75,6,Rockface moves to press my skin
in the cage,genesis,75,7,White liquid turn sour within
in the cage,genesis,75,8,Turn fast - turn sour
in the cage,genesis,75,9,Turn sweat - turn sour.
in the cage,genesis,75,10,Must tell myself that I'm not here.
in the cage,genesis,75,11,I'm drowning in a liquid fear.
in the cage,genesis,75,12,Bottled in a strong compression,
in the cage,genesis,75,13,My distortion shows obsession
in the cage,genesis,75,14,In the cave.
in the cage,genesis,75,15,Get me out of this cave!
in the cage,genesis,75,16,As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security, but this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him.
in the cage,genesis,75,17,If I keep my self-control,
in the cage,genesis,75,18,I'll be safe in my soul.
in the cage,genesis,75,19,And the childhood belief
in the cage,genesis,75,20,Brings a moment's relief,
in the cage,genesis,75,21,But my cynic soon returns
in the cage,genesis,75,22,And the lifeboat burns.
in the cage,genesis,75,23,My spirit just never learns.
in the cage,genesis,75,24,Stalactites, stalagmites
in the cage,genesis,75,25,Shut me in, lock me tight.
in the cage,genesis,75,26,Lips are dry, throat is dry.
in the cage,genesis,75,27,Feel like burning, stomach churning,
in the cage,genesis,75,28,I'm dressed up in a white costume
in the cage,genesis,75,29,Padding out leftover room.
in the cage,genesis,75,30,Body stretching, feel the wretching
in the cage,genesis,75,31,In the cage
in the cage,genesis,75,32,Get me out of the cage!
in the cage,genesis,75,33,At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a ropelike material.
in the cage,genesis,75,34,In the glare of a light,
in the cage,genesis,75,35,I see a strange kind of sight;
in the cage,genesis,75,36,Of cages joined to form a star
in the cage,genesis,75,37,Each person can't go very far;
in the cage,genesis,75,38,All tied to their things
in the cage,genesis,75,39,They're netted by their strings,
in the cage,genesis,75,40,Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
in the cage,genesis,75,41,As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in. John's face is motionless despite screams for help, but in his vacant expression a tear of blood forms and trickles down his cheek. Then he calmly walks away leaving Rael to face the pains which are beginning to sweep through his body.
in the cage,genesis,75,42,Outside the cage I see my Brother John,
in the cage,genesis,75,43,He turns his head so slowly round.
in the cage,genesis,75,44,I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
in the cage,genesis,75,45,And he looks at me without a sound.
in the cage,genesis,75,46,And I shout out 'John please help me!'
in the cage,genesis,75,47,But he does not even want to try to speak.
in the cage,genesis,75,48,I'm helpless in my violent rage
in the cage,genesis,75,49,And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
in the cage,genesis,75,50,And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
in the cage,genesis,75,51,My little runaway.
in the cage,genesis,75,52,(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my)
in the cage,genesis,75,53,In a trap, feel a strap
in the cage,genesis,75,54,Holding still. Pinned for kill.
in the cage,genesis,75,55,Chances narrow that I'll make it,
in the cage,genesis,75,56,In the cushioned straight-jacket.
in the cage,genesis,75,57,Just like 22nd Street,
in the cage,genesis,75,58,They got me by my neck and feet.
in the cage,genesis,75,59,Pressures building, can't take more.
in the cage,genesis,75,60,My headaches charge, earaches roar.
in the cage,genesis,75,61,In this pain
in the cage,genesis,75,62,Get me out of this pain.
in the cage,genesis,75,63,If I could change to liquid,
in the cage,genesis,75,64,I could fill the cracks up in the rocks.
in the cage,genesis,75,65,I know that I am solid
in the cage,genesis,75,66,And I am my own bad luck.
in the cage,genesis,75,67,However, just as John walks out of sight, the cage dissolves and Rael is left spinning like a top.
in the cage,genesis,75,68,Outside John disappears, my cage dissolves,
in the cage,genesis,75,69,without any reason my body revolves.
in the cage,genesis,75,70,Keep on turning,
in the cage,genesis,75,71,Keep on turning,
in the cage,genesis,75,72,Turning around,
in the cage,genesis,75,73,Spinning around.
in the cage,genesis,75,74,(round, round, round, round)

last night,chris de burgh,29,11,With her long black hair hanging down beneath the red light,
last night,chris de burgh,29,12,And she smiled, for the boys coming home from the war,
last night,chris de burgh,29,13,The boys coming home from the war;
last night,chris de burgh,29,14,And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
last night,chris de burgh,29,15,We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
last night,chris de burgh,29,16,And we said "nothing will make us change in any way,
last night,chris de burgh,29,17,Since yesterday, we're just the same,
last night,chris de burgh,29,18,Since yesterday, nothing has changed,
last night,chris de burgh,29,19,Since yesterday, we're just the same,"
last night,chris de burgh,29,20,But I can feel there's a new kind of hunger inside,
last night,chris de burgh,29,21,To be satisfied, I saw it there last night;
last night,chris de burgh,29,22,Last night I was walking through the shadows,
last night,chris de burgh,29,23,Far away from all the music and the girls,
last night,chris de burgh,29,24,When I saw a soldier waiting with a woman in black,
last night,chris de burgh,29,25,And they stood without any word,
last night,chris de burgh,29,26,Just staring at a photograph of someone, and she began to cry,
last night,chris de burgh,29,27,For a boy left behind in the war,
last night,chris de burgh,29,28,Some boy left behind in the war;
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,0,I can see you now by the light of the dawn
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,1,And the sun is rising slow
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,2,We have talked all night, and I can't talk anymore
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,3,But I must stay and you must go
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,4,You have always been such a good friend to me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,5,Through the thunder and the rain
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,6,And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,7,Lift your heart and think of me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,8,There are those who fail, there are those who fall
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,9,There are those who will never win
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,10,Then there are those who fight for the things they believe
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,11,And these are men like you and me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,12,In my dream we walked, you and I to the shore
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,13,Leaving footprints by the sea
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,14,And when there was just one set of prints in the sand
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,15,That was when you carried me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,16,You have always been such a good friend to me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,17,Through the thunder and the rain
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,18,And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,19,Lift your heart and think of me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,20,And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,21,Lift your heart and think of me
the snows of new york,chris de burgh,23,22,Lift your heart and think of me

self evident,ani difranco,181,0,Yes,
self evident,ani difranco,181,1,Us people are just poems
self evident,ani difranco,181,2,We're ninety percent metaphor
self evident,ani difranco,181,3,With a leanness of meaning
self evident,ani difranco,181,4,Approaching hyper-distillation
self evident,ani difranco,181,5,And once upon a time
self evident,ani difranco,181,6,We were moonshine
self evident,ani difranco,181,7,Rushing down the throat of a giraffe
self evident,ani difranco,181,8,Yes, rushing down the long hallway
self evident,ani difranco,181,9,Despite what the p.a. announcement says
self evident,ani difranco,181,10,Yes, rushing down the long hall
self evident,ani difranco,181,11,Down the long stairs
self evident,ani difranco,181,12,In a building so tall
self evident,ani difranco,181,13,That it will always be there
self evident,ani difranco,181,14,Yes, it's part of a pair
self evident,ani difranco,181,15,There on the bow of Noah's ark
self evident,ani difranco,181,16,The most prestigious couple
self evident,ani difranco,181,17,Just kickin' back parked
self evident,ani difranco,181,18,Against a perfectly blue sky
self evident,ani difranco,181,19,On a morning beatific
self evident,ani difranco,181,20,In its Indian summer breeze
self evident,ani difranco,181,21,On the day that America
self evident,ani difranco,181,22,Fell to its knees
self evident,ani difranco,181,23,After strutting around for a century
self evident,ani difranco,181,24,Without saying thank you
self evident,ani difranco,181,25,Or please
self evident,ani difranco,181,26,And the shock was subsonic
self evident,ani difranco,181,27,And the smoke was deafening
self evident,ani difranco,181,28,Between the setup and the punch line
self evident,ani difranco,181,29,Cause we were all on time for work that day
self evident,ani difranco,181,30,We all boarded that plane for to fly
self evident,ani difranco,181,31,And then while the fires were raging
self evident,ani difranco,181,32,We all climbed up on the window sill
self evident,ani difranco,181,33,And then we all held hands
self evident,ani difranco,181,34,And jumped into the sky
self evident,ani difranco,181,35,And every borough looked up when it heard the first blast
self evident,ani difranco,181,36,And then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed
self evident,ani difranco,181,37,And the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar
self evident,ani difranco,181,38,Looked more like war than anything I've seen so far
self evident,ani difranco,181,39,So far
self evident,ani difranco,181,40,So far
self evident,ani difranco,181,41,So fierce and ingenious
self evident,ani difranco,181,42,A poetic specter so far gone
self evident,ani difranco,181,43,That every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling
self evident,ani difranco,181,44,Over 'oh my god' and 'this is unbelievable' and on and on
self evident,ani difranco,181,45,And I'll tell you what, while we're at it
self evident,ani difranco,181,46,You can keep the pentagon
self evident,ani difranco,181,47,Keep the propaganda
self evident,ani difranco,181,48,Keep each and every tv
self evident,ani difranco,181,49,That's been trying to convince me
self evident,ani difranco,181,50,To participate
self evident,ani difranco,181,51,In some prep school punk's plan to perpetuate retribution
self evident,ani difranco,181,52,Perpetuate retribution
self evident,ani difranco,181,53,Even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution
self evident,ani difranco,181,54,Is still hanging in the air
self evident,ani difranco,181,55,And there's ash on our shoes
self evident,ani difranco,181,56,And there's ash in our hair
self evident,ani difranco,181,57,And there's a fine silt on every mantle
self evident,ani difranco,181,58,From hell's kitchen to Brooklyn
self evident,ani difranco,181,59,And the streets are full of stories
self evident,ani difranco,181,60,Sudden twists and near misses
self evident,ani difranco,181,61,And soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters
self evident,ani difranco,181,62,With tales of narrowly averted disasters
self evident,ani difranco,181,63,And the whiskey is flowin'
self evident,ani difranco,181,64,Like never before
self evident,ani difranco,181,65,As all over the country
self evident,ani difranco,181,66,Folks just shake their heads
self evident,ani difranco,181,67,And pour
self evident,ani difranco,181,68,So here's a toast to all the folks that live in Palestine, Afghanistan,
self evident,ani difranco,181,69,Iraq, El Salvador
self evident,ani difranco,181,70,Here's a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation
self evident,ani difranco,181,71,Under the stone cold gaze of Mt. Rushmore
self evident,ani difranco,181,72,Here's a toast to all those nurses and doctors
self evident,ani difranco,181,73,Who daily provide women with a choice
self evident,ani difranco,181,74,Who stand down a threat the size of Oklahoma City
self evident,ani difranco,181,75,Just to listen to a young woman's voice
self evident,ani difranco,181,76,Here's a toast to all the folks on death row right now
self evident,ani difranco,181,77,Awaiting the executioner's guillotine
self evident,ani difranco,181,78,Who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads
self evident,ani difranco,181,79,To find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream
self evident,ani difranco,181,80,Cause take away our PlayStations
self evident,ani difranco,181,81,And we are a third world nation
self evident,ani difranco,181,82,Under the thumb of some blue blood royal son
self evident,ani difranco,181,83,Who stole the oval office and that phony election
self evident,ani difranco,181,84,I mean
self evident,ani difranco,181,85,It don't take a weatherman
self evident,ani difranco,181,86,To look around and see the weather
self evident,ani difranco,181,87,Jeb said he'd deliver Florida, folks
self evident,ani difranco,181,88,And boy did he ever
self evident,ani difranco,181,89,And we hold these truths to be self evident:
self evident,ani difranco,181,90,Number one, George W. Bush is not president
self evident,ani difranco,181,91,Number two, America is not a true democracy
self evident,ani difranco,181,92,Number three, the media is not fooling me
self evident,ani difranco,181,93,Cause I am a poem heeding hyper-distillation
self evident,ani difranco,181,94,I've got no room for a lie so verbose
self evident,ani difranco,181,95,I'm looking out over my whole human family
self evident,ani difranco,181,96,And I'm raising my glass in a toast
self evident,ani difranco,181,97,Here's to our last drink of fossil fuels
self evident,ani difranco,181,98,May we vow to get off of this sauce
self evident,ani difranco,181,99,Shoo away the swarms of commuter planes
self evident,ani difranco,181,100,And find that train ticket we lost
self evident,ani difranco,181,101,Cause once upon a time the line followed the river
self evident,ani difranco,181,102,And peeked into all the backyards
self evident,ani difranco,181,103,And the laundry was waving
self evident,ani difranco,181,104,The graffiti was teasing us
self evident,ani difranco,181,105,From brick walls and bridges
self evident,ani difranco,181,106,We were rolling over ridges
self evident,ani difranco,181,107,Through valleys
self evident,ani difranco,181,108,Under stars
self evident,ani difranco,181,109,I dream of touring like Duke Ellington
self evident,ani difranco,181,110,In my own railroad car
self evident,ani difranco,181,111,I dream of waiting on the tall blond wooden benches
self evident,ani difranco,181,112,In a grand station aglow with grace
self evident,ani difranco,181,113,And then standing out on the platform
self evident,ani difranco,181,114,And feeling the air on my face
self evident,ani difranco,181,115,Give back the night its distant whistle
self evident,ani difranco,181,116,Give the darkness back its soul
self evident,ani difranco,181,117,Give the big oil companies the finger finally
self evident,ani difranco,181,118,And relearn how to rock-n-roll
self evident,ani difranco,181,119,Yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there
self evident,ani difranco,181,120,So it's time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets
self evident,ani difranco,181,121,And clear the air
self evident,ani difranco,181,122,Get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand
self evident,ani difranco,181,123,Of someone else's desert
self evident,ani difranco,181,124,Put it back in its pants
self evident,ani difranco,181,125,And quit the hypocritical chants of
self evident,ani difranco,181,126,Freedom forever
self evident,ani difranco,181,127,Cause when one lone phone rang
self evident,ani difranco,181,128,In two thousand and one
self evident,ani difranco,181,129,At ten after nine
self evident,ani difranco,181,130,On nine one one
self evident,ani difranco,181,131,Which is the number we all called
self evident,ani difranco,181,132,When that lone phone rang right off the wall
self evident,ani difranco,181,133,Right off our desk and down the long hall
self evident,ani difranco,181,134,Down the long stairs
self evident,ani difranco,181,135,In a building so tall
self evident,ani difranco,181,136,That the whole world turned
self evident,ani difranco,181,137,Just to watch it fall
self evident,ani difranco,181,138,And while we're at it
self evident,ani difranco,181,139,Remember the first time around?
self evident,ani difranco,181,140,The bomb?
self evident,ani difranco,181,141,The Ryder truck?
self evident,ani difranco,181,142,The parking garage?
self evident,ani difranco,181,143,The princess that didn't even feel the pea?
self evident,ani difranco,181,144,Remember joking around in our apartment on Avenue D?
self evident,ani difranco,181,145,Can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design
self evident,ani difranco,181,146,Following a fantastical reversal of the New York skyline?!
self evident,ani difranco,181,147,It was a joke
self evident,ani difranco,181,148,At the time
self evident,ani difranco,181,149,And that was just a few years ago

hurricane,ani difranco,100,0,Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
hurricane,ani difranco,100,1,Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
hurricane,ani difranco,100,2,She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
hurricane,ani difranco,100,3,Cries out, "My God, they killed them all"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,4,Here comes the story of the hurricane
hurricane,ani difranco,100,5,The man, the authorities came to blame
hurricane,ani difranco,100,6,For somethin' that he never done
hurricane,ani difranco,100,7,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
hurricane,ani difranco,100,8,The champion of the world
hurricane,ani difranco,100,9,Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see?
hurricane,ani difranco,100,10,And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
hurricane,ani difranco,100,11,"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
hurricane,ani difranco,100,12,"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
hurricane,ani difranco,100,13,I saw them leavin'" he says, and he stops
hurricane,ani difranco,100,14,"One of us had better call up the cops"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,15,And so Patty calls the cops
hurricane,ani difranco,100,16,And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
hurricane,ani difranco,100,17,In the hot New Jersey night
hurricane,ani difranco,100,18,Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
hurricane,ani difranco,100,19,Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
hurricane,ani difranco,100,20,Number one contender for the middleweight crown
hurricane,ani difranco,100,21,Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
hurricane,ani difranco,100,22,When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
hurricane,ani difranco,100,23,Just like the time before and the time before that
hurricane,ani difranco,100,24,In Paterson that's just the way things go
hurricane,ani difranco,100,25,If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
hurricane,ani difranco,100,26,'Less you wanna draw the heat
hurricane,ani difranco,100,27,Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
hurricane,ani difranco,100,28,Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
hurricane,ani difranco,100,29,He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
hurricane,ani difranco,100,30,They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,31,And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
hurricane,ani difranco,100,32,Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,33,So they took him to the infirmary
hurricane,ani difranco,100,34,And though this man could hardly see
hurricane,ani difranco,100,35,They told him that he could identify the guilty men
hurricane,ani difranco,100,36,Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
hurricane,ani difranco,100,37,Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
hurricane,ani difranco,100,38,The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
hurricane,ani difranco,100,39,Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,40,Yes, here's the story of the hurricane
hurricane,ani difranco,100,41,The man the authorities came to blame
hurricane,ani difranco,100,42,For somethin' that he never done
hurricane,ani difranco,100,43,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
hurricane,ani difranco,100,44,The champion of the world
hurricane,ani difranco,100,45,Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
hurricane,ani difranco,100,46,Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
hurricane,ani difranco,100,47,While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
hurricane,ani difranco,100,48,And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
hurricane,ani difranco,100,49,Lookin' for somebody to blame
hurricane,ani difranco,100,50,"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,51,"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,52,"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,53,"Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,54,"Don't forget that you are white"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,55,Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,56,Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break
hurricane,ani difranco,100,57,We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
hurricane,ani difranco,100,58,Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
hurricane,ani difranco,100,59,You'll be doin' society a favor
hurricane,ani difranco,100,60,That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
hurricane,ani difranco,100,61,We want to put his ass in stir
hurricane,ani difranco,100,62,We want to pin this triple murder on him
hurricane,ani difranco,100,63,He ain't no gentleman Jim"
hurricane,ani difranco,100,64,Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
hurricane,ani difranco,100,65,But he never did like to talk about it all that much
hurricane,ani difranco,100,66,It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
hurricane,ani difranco,100,67,And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
hurricane,ani difranco,100,68,Up to some paradise
hurricane,ani difranco,100,69,Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
hurricane,ani difranco,100,70,And ride a horse along a trail
hurricane,ani difranco,100,71,But then they took him to the jailhouse
hurricane,ani difranco,100,72,Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
hurricane,ani difranco,100,73,All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
hurricane,ani difranco,100,74,The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
hurricane,ani difranco,100,75,The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
hurricane,ani difranco,100,76,To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
hurricane,ani difranco,100,77,And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
hurricane,ani difranco,100,78,No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
hurricane,ani difranco,100,79,And though they could not produce the gun
hurricane,ani difranco,100,80,The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
hurricane,ani difranco,100,81,And the all-white jury agreed
hurricane,ani difranco,100,82,Rubin Carter was falsely tried
hurricane,ani difranco,100,83,The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
hurricane,ani difranco,100,84,Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
hurricane,ani difranco,100,85,And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
hurricane,ani difranco,100,86,How can the life of such a man
hurricane,ani difranco,100,87,Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
hurricane,ani difranco,100,88,To see him obviously framed
hurricane,ani difranco,100,89,Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
hurricane,ani difranco,100,90,Where justice is a game
hurricane,ani difranco,100,91,Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
hurricane,ani difranco,100,92,Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
hurricane,ani difranco,100,93,While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell

uptown,chicago,22,1,Lookin' through the smog that surrounds the mornin' light
uptown,chicago,22,2,The shades of brown. it gets me down, exactly like my life
uptown,chicago,22,3,I don't deserve the hand I'm dealt, a flush in spades of strife
uptown,chicago,22,4,I've grown tired of speeches that are nothing but a bore
uptown,chicago,22,5,So I'm rounding up the broken me and headin' on out the door
uptown,chicago,22,6,Without no lag I'm packin' my bag of discontented frowns
uptown,chicago,22,7,And hopping numer eighty-six, the first train that is freedom bound
uptown,chicago,22,8,Got my bag of many frowns and I'm takin' it on uptown
uptown,chicago,22,9,Big city lights
uptown,chicago,22,10,Funkier nights
uptown,chicago,22,11,Happier days
uptown,chicago,22,12,Goin' my way
uptown,chicago,22,13,It should be right
uptown,chicago,22,14,But I'm still uptight
uptown,chicago,22,15,Hey, I better put down
uptown,chicago,22,16,And get movin' on
uptown,chicago,22,17,I'm through with aggravation
uptown,chicago,22,18,Don't deserve the degradation
uptown,chicago,22,19,I'm putting all the negatives down
uptown,chicago,22,20,To hop the train that's feedom bound for uptown
uptown,chicago,22,21,Got my bag of many frowns and I'm takin' it on uptown

far away,blues traveler,31,1,Sometimes when I'm far away I ask myself
far away,blues traveler,31,2,Are you all right, are you okay
far away,blues traveler,31,3,Sometimes I laugh out loud or to myself
far away,blues traveler,31,4,Thinking about something funny you might say
far away,blues traveler,31,5,When I'm far away
far away,blues traveler,31,6,Do you call my name
far away,blues traveler,31,7,This is something I need to know
far away,blues traveler,31,8,When you call my name
far away,blues traveler,31,9,Do you really think of me
far away,blues traveler,31,10,Please won't you tell me yes or no
far away,blues traveler,31,11,I'm thinking back on all the times I needed you
far away,blues traveler,31,12,But knew somehow it was never meant to be
far away,blues traveler,31,13,Then I have to ask myself just one more time
far away,blues traveler,31,14,Was there ever once that you just needed me
far away,blues traveler,31,15,When I'm far away
far away,blues traveler,31,16,Do you call my name
far away,blues traveler,31,17,This is something I need to know
far away,blues traveler,31,18,When you call my name
far away,blues traveler,31,19,Do you really think of me
far away,blues traveler,31,20,Please won't you tell me yes or no
far away,blues traveler,31,21,I guess all that's left to say is I'm proud of you
far away,blues traveler,31,22,I hope that I'll see you again some day
far away,blues traveler,31,23,And I know very well I'll be near you again
far away,blues traveler,31,24,The time will come when I won't be too far away

hudson,dar williams,34,0,If we're lucky we feel our lives
hudson,dar williams,34,1,Know when the next scene arrives
hudson,dar williams,34,2,So often we start in the middle and work our way out
hudson,dar williams,34,3,we go to some Grey sky diner for eggs and toast
hudson,dar williams,34,4,New York Times or the New York Post
hudson,dar williams,34,5,Then we take a ride through the valley of the shadow of death
hudson,dar williams,34,6,But even for us New Yorkers, there's a time in every day
hudson,dar williams,34,7,The river takes our breath away
hudson,dar williams,34,8,[Chorus:]
hudson,dar williams,34,9,And the Hudson, it holds the life
hudson,dar williams,34,10,We thought we did it on our own
hudson,dar williams,34,11,The river roads collect the tolls
hudson,dar williams,34,12,For the passage of our souls
hudson,dar williams,34,13,Through silence, over woods, through flowers and snow
hudson,dar williams,34,14,And past the George Washington Bridge
hudson,dar williams,34,15,Down from the trails of Breakneck Ridge
hudson,dar williams,34,16,The river's ancient path is sacred and slow
hudson,dar williams,34,17,And as it swings through Harlem,
hudson,dar williams,34,18,It's every shade of blue
hudson,dar williams,34,19,Into the city of the new brand new
hudson,dar williams,34,20,And the Hudson, it holds the life
hudson,dar williams,34,21,We thought we did it on our own
hudson,dar williams,34,22,I thought I had no sense of place or past
hudson,dar williams,34,23,Time was too slow, but then too fast
hudson,dar williams,34,24,The river takes us home at last
hudson,dar williams,34,25,Where and when does the memory take hold
hudson,dar williams,34,26,Mountain range in the Autumn cold
hudson,dar williams,34,27,And I thought West Point was Camelot in the spring
hudson,dar williams,34,28,If you're lucky you'll find something that reflects you
hudson,dar williams,34,29,Helps you feel your life protects you
hudson,dar williams,34,30,Cradles you and connects you to everything
hudson,dar williams,34,31,This whole life I remember as they begged them to itself
hudson,dar williams,34,32,Never turn me into someone else
hudson,dar williams,34,33,[Chorus x2]
spring street,dar williams,48,0,I'm sorry that I left you
spring street,dar williams,48,1,With your questions all alone
spring street,dar williams,48,2,But I was too happy driving
spring street,dar williams,48,3,And too angry to drive home
spring street,dar williams,48,4,I was thinking about the easy courage
spring street,dar williams,48,5,Of my distant friends
spring street,dar williams,48,6,They said I could let this bridge wash out
spring street,dar williams,48,7,And never make amends
spring street,dar williams,48,8,Can I blow this small town
spring street,dar williams,48,9,Make a big sound
spring street,dar williams,48,10,Like the star of a film noir postcard
spring street,dar williams,48,11,Can I just forget the frames I shared with you
spring street,dar williams,48,12,And I can't believe what they're saying
spring street,dar williams,48,13,They're saying I can change my mind
spring street,dar williams,48,14,Start over on Spring Street
spring street,dar williams,48,15,I'm welcome anytime
spring street,dar williams,48,16,Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
spring street,dar williams,48,17,Floating on their neon stems
spring street,dar williams,48,18,There are new shirts on the clothes racks
spring street,dar williams,48,19,Should I feel like one of them
spring street,dar williams,48,20,I can find a small apartment
spring street,dar williams,48,21,Where a struggling artist died
spring street,dar williams,48,22,And pretend because I pay the rent
spring street,dar williams,48,23,I know that pain inside
spring street,dar williams,48,24,Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
spring street,dar williams,48,25,Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
spring street,dar williams,48,26,Take the best part
spring street,dar williams,48,27,Write it in your caffeine diary
spring street,dar williams,48,28,And I can't believe what they're saying
spring street,dar williams,48,29,They're saying I can leave tonight
spring street,dar williams,48,30,Start over on Spring Street
spring street,dar williams,48,31,I'm welcome anytime
spring street,dar williams,48,32,This year April had a blizzard
spring street,dar williams,48,33,Just to show she did not care
spring street,dar williams,48,34,And the new dead leaves
spring street,dar williams,48,35,They made the trees look like children with gray hair
spring street,dar williams,48,36,But I'll push myself up through the dirt
spring street,dar williams,48,37,And shake my petals free
spring street,dar williams,48,38,I'm resolved to being born
spring street,dar williams,48,39,And so resigned to bravery
spring street,dar williams,48,40,Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
spring street,dar williams,48,41,Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
spring street,dar williams,48,42,Houses floating, love is like that
spring street,dar williams,48,43,We built on the river
spring street,dar williams,48,44,And that's to say, yeah I'm leaving
spring street,dar williams,48,45,But I don't have to go there
spring street,dar williams,48,46,I don't have to go to Spring Street
spring street,dar williams,48,47,'Cause it's spring everywhere...
